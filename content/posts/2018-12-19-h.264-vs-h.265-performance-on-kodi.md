My christmas holidays have just begun and I've been trying to play some media files on Kodi.
This blog post is mainly a result of frustruation where some media files just won't play on two of my
low-cost computing devices (Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and Amazon Fire TV Stick) and in hope that this blog post will be
a good partner to me if someday I in the future decide to tinker further.

I first hooked my Pi 2 containing some media files on its SD card storage to an HDMI display.
