I got myself Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro for my Raspberry Pi 5 to make protoyping and playing around with
electronics a little easier! It comes with a cool blue looking 170-points breadboard.

It however lacks a latch point for mounting more breadboards with it.

I had a few more cool white looking 170-points breadboard
lying around which have latching points. So I got one of them stickied onto my Explorer HAT!

Now I can mount more breadboards!
