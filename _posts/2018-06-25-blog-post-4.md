We're currently working on developing a new Plasma subclass. It is supposed to read
HDF5 files that are based on OpenPMD standard and we have a sort of prototype ready
in [#500](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/500). It should be ready to
merge once we figure out how we are supposed to handle the example datasets for our
tests. It probably isn't a good idea to ship them with the main PlasmaPy codebase.
I guess we're going to settle downloading them on the fly when running our tests.

I was having trouble getting
[OpenPMD-api](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api) to install from source and
with spack package manager but those guys at OpenPMD were really helpful and
updated their documentation appropriately real quick
([openPMD/openPMD-api#279](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/issues/279)) so
that newcomers like me don't have to go through unnecessary trouble. ;)

An update from my last blog post on our coveragerc problems, in the end
we decided to settle with [#502](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/502).
The problem is that PlasmaPy and SunPy (maybe others?) depend on Astropy's testing
modules which is the root cause of the problem. We've had some discussion in
[astropy/astropy-helpers#397](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-helpers/issues/397).
However, [@Cadiar](https://github.com/Cadair) is still messing around with it in
SunPy and has made progress in
[sunpy/sunpy#2667](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/pull/2667). Hopefully, astropy
will go through some refactoring too and then we could all live peacefully. :)

Some other cool stuff that happened during this period. We increased coverage
in our langmuir.py module in [#498](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/pull/498).
There are still some corners where could increase coverage a bit, I think I am
going to make more PRs soon. I remember we had 99% code coverage in March then it
dropped to somewhere around 92% shortly after we had our first release. I am glad
we made it back to 98% as of now!

Oh, I almost forgot! I received my first stipend a few days back! I've never
earned more in my whole life before this, not even a quarter to be honest.
I am not sure what I am going to do with it for now. Maybe get a new lappy?
A musical instrument? Pay the bills? Donate to a cause? No idea but it makes me
happy to think about stuff! :D

That's all folks. Stay happy, have fun!
