I Got Here\nI've known about GSoC for a while but wasn't sure if it was something\nI could be a part of. I decided to give it my first try this year. I got to know about\nOpenAstronomy from the GSoC'18 organizations page. Initially, almost all of the\nprojects on their ideas page were very appealing to me. I started to get to know more about\ndifferent communities under OpenAstronomy and submitted patches to their\ncodebase to some of them. It was fun to contribute to them but I was still not sure\nwhich organization and what project would work best for me.\nAfter thinking for a while, I decided to settle on the project to develop a better way\nof dealing with different types of plasma data structures using metaclasses under the\nPlasmaPy organization.\nThese guys were still progressing to v0.1.0 and to have it up on PyPi. I imagined it\nwould be nice to give a hand and speed up things a bit as well as this was the\nfirst time I was going to work with Python metaclasses in an actual real-world project,\nmetaclasses are some nasty Python dark magic! I spent most of march working on a proposal\nand invloving with the PlasmaPy community. To my surprise, my proposal got selected for GSoC'18!\nBonding Period\nWe're currently in the community bonding phase where I am getting to know more about\nour community and my GSoC project. By the way, we also had our v0.1.0 release and\na brand new logo for our organization during this phase. Here is the glimpse of it!\n\nAs for the GSoC project, since PlasmaPy only supports Python 3.6+, it was suggested that\nwe use a base class that is a subclass of\nABC.abc instead of defining\na metaclass. Python 3.6 brought this amazing method\n__init_subclass__\nthat would make for a great replacement to register our subclasses.\nIn the first Jitsi meeting we had yesterday, we discussed about the project and\nsome stuff about what my mentors are expecting from me.\nOur implemenation is supposed to be quite similar to how\nsunpy.map.Map works.\nEnding Thoughts\nI'm very excited about the journey next 3 months! I'll probably end up learning a\nlot more about metaprogamming in Python and in general. I am grateful to OpenAstronomy\nand my mentors for giving me this amazing opportunity and helping me get started!\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2018/05/11/community-bonding-period-plasmapy/","title":"Community Bonding Period"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2018/05/28/structuring-the-plasma-factory/":{"body":"We're mostly done with structuring our Plasma factory. The PR\n(#459) just got merged yesterday! I'd have to say\nwe weren't expecting this to work out this quickly.\nThe reference to\nSunPy's Map\nsource made it a tad easier to understand how things are supposed to work for our PlasmaPy's\nPlasma. :D\nAlso, SunPy's BasicRegistrationFactory\nwas so generic that we could have directly imported it in PlasmaPy without having to work out on\none on our own (wow, that's a lot of \"o\"s!). But really, I wonder\nif it makes more sense that they should just publish a separate PyPi package for just this\nregistration factory.\nIf we didn't had any such reference, I am certain that our factory implementation would have consumed\na lot more time than we actually took.\nAnyway, there are plenty of things that probably would need work in near future, like\noverriding methods under BasicRegistraionFactory being inherited in PlasmaFactory to make it more\nspecific as we get to know our subclass needs, and defining generic plasma methods which are\ncommon in most plasmas (electronTemperature, ionTemperature, etc.) under a GenericPlasma class.\nWe'll get to learn more about these needs as we work on subclasses for our Plasma factory as well.\nCurrently, We've been discussing about what subclasses would be nice to have\n(some bits can be found in #458).\nAnd so, this is our next plan, to create variety of subclasses that deal with different plasma datasets.\nSome of the openly available datasets we've located are\nDense plasma database,\nJohns Hopkins Turbulence Database and some\nexample datasets using the\nOpenPMD stanadard.\nBy the way, if by any chance you're working on a particle-mesh dataset, I'd recommend you to use the\nconventions under OpenPMD standard. It has the potential to make particle-mesh databases easier for other\npeople to visually parse and automate!\nLately, I've been working with h5py python package which allows parsing\nthe HDF5 binary data format. I'm very excited since this is going to be my\nfirst time working in such a close proximity to large scientific datasets!\nThat will be all for now. See ya later.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2018/05/28/structuring-the-plasma-factory/","title":"Structuring our Plasma factory"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2018/06/13/completing-our-plasma-factory-implementation/":{"body":"As we all (probably) know now, our Plasma factory implementation got finished much\nsooner than expected. So, I've been mostly lurking around since my last blog post\nadding features in our plasma pie, discovering bugs under our plasma bed, reviewing\nplasma requests, gazing at stars made of plasma, etc.\nI'll talk about some of the progress that's being made in PlasmaPy. I made a PR\n(#483) that allows us to pass collections\nto our particle_input decorator. This was my first time working with decorators in real\nworld programming. It seems like it turned out pretty well. Oh and\n#493 was cute.\nI also moved around tests for our plasma subclasses\n(#489).\nOne thing I noticed during this PR that it is important to have __init__.py in each of\nyour directory, otherwise any tests in directories without __init__.py are not going\nto be picked up with ./setup.py test! However, they seem to work when using pytest\ndirectly though. I found a similar problem with\n#494 which shot up our coverage from\n93.18% and 95.38%. It is pretty surprising, a single empty __init__.py can do wonders.\nSo, if anyone is reading this uses ./setup.py test in their projects right now, you better\ntake care of such stuff in your codebase. You really don't want to be writing tests only\nto realize it later on that they aren't even being executed.\nAlso, we recently shifted to CodeCov instead of Coveralls. Why? No big reason except CodeCov\napparently has a greater userbase.\nand some minor differences can be found here.\nWe are currently fighting with coveragerc configuration file not being picked up by coverage,\nwhich is a code coverage measurement in tool for Python.\n(#495,\n#496,\n#497). So, some stuff like # coveralls: ignore\ndoes not get respected and coverage marks these lines in red (meaning that they aren't covered)\ninstead of just leaving them whitish (ignoring them).\nWe could replace # coveralls: ignore with # pragma: no cover since that is the\ndefault for coverage and it works with CodeCov integration\n(ritiek/PlasmaPy#3), but this might\nleave other future additions to coveragerc file still a problem if it isn't going to be picked up\nby coverage. There is a workaround that seems\nto be sort of working (ritiek/PlasmaPy#4, do\nnotice it further shoots up our coverage from 95.38% to 96.69%!) and is probably bit ugly but\nshould hopefully suffice for the moment if we can't find a better solution.\nThe next little bit related to GSoC is that I expect to create a Plasma subclass which reads\nHDF5 files that are based upon OpenPMD format using h5py python module and then expose relevant\nattributes of information.\nI suspect it isn't going to be a big task but we'll get to shed light on further details once\nwe see this little bit happen in PlasmaPy.\nOK that would be all for now.

This noise wasn't the kind of usual constant white noise buzzing from\nthe speakers. Instead, my connected speakers would make a crackle noise at regular intervals and then\nremain perfectly noise-less for the remaining period. This periodic noise only appeared when the speakers\nwere connected to the Pi and didn't happen with any other device.\nI read lots of stuff on the internet. Most of which is mentioned in\nhere.\nMost people as I've read around were mainly either lucky by setting:\n\nor\n\nto /boot/config.txt. However, I tried these settings in every possible combination but still\ndidn't seem to fix for me.\nNext thing I wondered about my power supply being crappy but nah. Same results with different adapaters,\ndifferent cables and different power sources. Failing to discover any possible fix, I gave up and settled\nwith a USB sound card lying around in my house assuming I might have accidently messed up with the hardware\non the board itself and also many people on the web mentioned that the 3.5mm audio jack is kinda sub-par.\nComing back; Recently, my laptop's audio jack also got ripped off and I decided to rather use the USB sound\ncard as a workaround which was connected to my Pi than buy a new one as I am usually not listening to music\n24/7 in my house with the Pi.\nThis worked quite well but was a pain to pull off and plugin the sound card every time and I wanted music to\nsurround me.

So, adding my old configuration line-by-line\nwith a consecutive reboot, I was able to pin-point the problem to this line:\n\nI remember reading it at the time somewhere (see relevant post)\nthat it increases the CPU frequency during the boot period so that the Pi can complete loading the kernel faster\nand then reverts back to the usual frequency depending on the configuration.

These files act\nas a middle man between an application software and the kernel to interact with the hardware input\ndevices connected to the system. To know what devices are connected to your system, run:\n\nThis should give you list of input devices attached to your machine at the moment. For example,\nthe output above contains information about my laptop's touchpad. The corresponding event file of my\nmouse is /dev/input/event5. Let's try to cat it (you may need root):\n\nIt wouldn't normally output anything, but you should get lots of weird output on placing a finger\non your touchpad, here is what it looks on my laptop:\n\nThis output is actually a serialized struct corresponding to following data of an input device:\n\nThe docs here contain some detailed information on input devices in Linux:\nhttps://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/input.txt.\nSomeone on stackoverflow has written some Python code on how this output can be decoded into\nreadable form, here https://stackoverflow.com/a/16682549/6554943.\nThere is also a Python package named evdev\nwhich allows us to both read events and write custom events to these device files.\nLet's get to the nasty stuff now.\nIt is also possible to read the event device files of another machine via SSH, like so:\n\nMake sure the user has been granted read access to the event device file, otherwise you'll get\na permission denied error. This can be done by running $ sudo gpasswd -a USER input. Replace\nUSER with the host's username. If it still doesn't work, a hacky workaround would be to use\nchmod with appropriate permissions on the event device file to allow read access to the\nunprivileged user. Either way, you should now be able to read the event device file of the other\nmachine.\nIf the client machine's and the host machine's architecture are the same (say both are x64). You\ncould also pipe events from the host machine to your machine! I tried this and it seemed to work\nwith keyboards but didn't work with mouse.\n\nOn running this, you would be able to pipe device data from the host machine to your client machine.\nBoth event devices should correspond to the same input device for it to work, that is, say /dev/input/event1\nis the keyboard device on the host machine whereas /dev/input/event4 is the keyboard device on the client\nmachine. Anything entered on the host machine via the keyboard will now also mimic on the client machine.\nHowever, this does not \"grab\" the input received on host machine. That is, pressing a keyboard key\nwould perform an operation on the client operation but the same operation will also be performed on the\nhost machine. I'd rather pass all event data to my client machine and block the event data from reaching\nthe event device file on the host machine. In this way, one could work wirelessly without worrying\nabout the input device causing the same effects on the host machine when one is focused on the client\nmachine.\nWhat if the host machine's architecture and the client machine's architecture are not the same?\nI tried the same procedure above to share the keyboard attached to my Raspberry Pi Zero W with my x64\nmachine. Meaning everything entered on the Pi Zero will also be mimiced on my x64 machine.\nHowever, it didn't work. If you remember the struct above, all of the items in that struct were\nsame for the same set of keys pressed, except for value. The value of value parameter seems\nto be architecture dependent.\nI imagined a possible a way to get around this would be to read the event device file of a remote\nmachine having a different architecture and modify the value parameter such that it is correctly read\nby the kernel and then write this new data to my local event device file. So, I went on a quest but\nnot much later I came across https://github.com/Blub/netevent/ which\nprobably does the same thing (\"probably\", because I am not a C++ guy). The example given in their README\n\"sharing keyboard &amp; mouse with a machine via ssh\" does exacty what we need - sharing event device files\nbetween architectures. It also offers the ability to share devices that are not present in the client\nmachine. For example, I could share an X-Box controller which is connected to my host machine, with my client\nmachine which does not have any event device file for parsing X-Box controller events (I think it might\nbe possible to achieve this via $ mknod command but I haven't tried yet). One would need to add the event\ndevices he/she wishes to share via SSH in the netevent-setup.ne2 file and add a hotkey on the host machine\nwhich would then pipe the output of the written /dev/input/event* device files to the client machine.\nAnother good thing is that it \"grabs\" the input events on the host machine. So, the events are only\nreceived by the client machine while all the input on the host machine is blocked from reaching the event\ndevice file present on the host machine itself.\nAlso, since Android is based on the Linux kernel - it is very much possible to run netevent on it. In\nfact, I was able to compile the codebase for Termux on my rooted Android Phone with a few modifications\nhttps://github.com/ritiek/netevent/tree/termux.\nYou must need root to access /dev/input/event* files on\nAndroid. After completing the intial setup, it allowed me to virtually connect my Linux machine's keyboard,\nmouse, gamepad, powerlid switch, power button (, you name it!) to my Android Phone. Moving the touch pad of\nmy Laptop moved a mouse pointer on the Phone (I never knew my Phone could display a mouse pointer!), the\npower button on my laptop turns off/on the phone screen! If you're going to try this out, make sure you export\nthe LD_LIBRARY_PATH for root user before executing the netevent binary via SSH. To do so, replace your output\ncommand in netevent-setup.ne2 with something like this:\n\nI was also able to make my Android Phone act the host machine and share my Phone's power and volume buttons\nwith my laptop to perform actions which is equivalent to pressing the power button / changing the system\nvolume on my laptop. However, the touch on my Android didn't seem to perform anything on the laptop, not\neven control the mouse as one would expect. I saw that there were additional /dev/input/event* files\ncreated on my laptop and the Android touch on was being registered on my when I cat the appropriate device\nevent file on my laptop but it seems like my laptop has no idea what the event data it received is supposed to do. There might\nbe some more things possible like sharing the fingerprint scanner with the Linux machine (I tried it but\ncouldn't get it to work, but someone more experienced might have a better chance).\nI also have a jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite 3, so I decided to give it a try as well. Turns out I was able\nto cross-compile netevent for Kindle using arm-linux-gnueabi-cpp-4.9 cross-compiler (seems like the apt\npackage g++-4.9-arm-linux-gnueabi is only available on older distro versions like Ubuntu Xenial, so I\ncreated a Travis CI build which runs Xenial and used it to cross-compile for Kindle and allowed it to put\nup the generated binary on the internet for me to download). For some reason, it looks like g++-5 and later\ndo not work with the Kindle. It would complain about some missing libraries I have no idea to workaround\nthem. Anyway, transferred the binary generated g++-4.9 to my Kindle and worked without a hitch. My Kindle\nPaperwhite 3 doesn't offer many input devices, only the power button device file and touch screen device\nfile were located inside /dev/input/. Set the Kindle power button as the hotkey for netevent.

I\nprimarily use mpv-player for everything multimedia. So, naturally I went on to tinker\nif I could somehow synchronize playback on different devices with mpv.\nI went ahead with my Laptop and Raspberry Pi and saw they have a pretty noticeable difference in startup times of mpv.\nI thought if I could synchronize the startup times of mpv between machines, every other piece of the puzzle would\nautomatically fall into place, since there is probably no computation lag on my machines when decoding an audio\nencoding to be played by the speaker in real-time. I synchronized my\ndevice clocks from an external NTP server and launched mpv with the following params:\n\nI imagined this would workaround mpv's startup time, and once both are ready - I would instruct the\nIPC server to unpause the mpv on both my Laptop and Raspberry Pi at the\nsame time. Boom! We would now have same audio being given off by both the devices. I installed\nat tool which allows you to run a\ncommand at a specific time. I added an entry to unpause mpv at a specific time on both devices. Something like this:\n\nI tested this but for some reason I would usually end up with reasonable gap between the audio like 1 second or so -\nenough for any human ear to detect the out-of-sync audio. I suspect this gap might occur from several reasons, at\ncommand only checks at a gap of every second to see if there is any job. Let's say at previously checked at 20:27:59\nand 900 milliseconds. The next time it checks for a pending job might be on 20:28:00 and 900 milliseconds. We're\nalready late by 900 milliseconds. I'm not sure whether this is the case but it could take some investigation.\nSecond reason might probably be because of the small delays that occur on the Raspberry Pi when executing at and\nwriting the data with socat to mpv's IPC server. The last one would be as simple as the clocks of the two machines\nare not really synchronized in the order of milliseconds. Or a combination of these. Anyway, I couldn't get it to\nwork reliably with this approach.\nSo I gave up, and a bit of looking up on the Internet for external utilities. I tried out one such software mentioned -\nSyncplay which supports multiple players and mpv being one of them. make\nwent without problems. Although, I initially had trouble to get audio-only (since Syncplay is more tailored to video syncing)\noutput working on my headless Raspberry Pi,\nbut I found out you could pass additional parameters to the player and disabled the video output (I also created an issue\n#229):\n\nOn my laptop, I launched the same command without any additional parameters to the player:\n\nThis resulted in mpv running in pseudo GUI mode on my laptop and I could control the player with it (seek, un/pause).\nAdjusting the playback so would also cause similar changes to the syncplay client instance running on my Pi. It seems\nto work pretty well but can sometimes the audio may get out-of-sync. I found that seeking backwards/forwards a bit can\nhelp eliminate out-of-sync issues. Syncplay, however, does not seem whether it is intended for such a purpose (of syncing\naudio between machines). Its main purpose (as on their GitHub page) seems to mainly focus on video playing so that viewers\ncan watch the same thing at the same time, as it states:\n\nSolution to synchronize video playback across multiple instances of mpv, VLC, MPC-HC, MPC-BE and mplayer2 over the\nInternet.\n\nLike with most command-line software I find cool, I tried to get Syncplay running on my Android with Termux. However, mpv isn't\ncompiled with Lua support when installed with pkg on Termux and I didn't want to go through the trouble of\nsetting up the toolchain to compile it for Android. Turns out, I just needed to disable loading the Lua script\nas in https://github.com/ritiek/syncplay/tree/mpv-without-lua-support\nand somehow everything turned out to be fine!\nEither way, I'll keep Syncplay.\nI still haven't dug in the Syncplay codebase deep enough to understand how everything works yet. It might be\na fun thing to do so in my spare time.\nI also found out Snapcast (especially tailored to sync audio) to work pretty well\nmight like it even more than Syncplay for audio syncing purposes! Although, I'll still stick to Syncplay for anything video\nsyncing.\nI've done a revised section on syncing audio playback in this post.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2019/04/01/synchronizing-multimedia-playback-on-different-machines/","title":"Synchronizing multimedia playback on different machines"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2019/05/31/i-installed-linux-on-my-usb-flash-drive/":{"body":"In my university, we mostly have only-Windows computers. What I mean by \"only-windows computers\" that the computers\nhave Windows as the only operating system installed on them. Now, I always like to be accompanied by a terminal\nwith everything I do (even writing this post in a TUI on Linux) and avoid proprietary software whenever possible.\nBy the way, cmder is a pretty good project that adds the missing flakes (like\nwget, curl, etc.) to the command-prompt but it doesn't change the fact that Windows itself is still closed-source\n(atleast as of writing this). Me, being an avid supporter of open-source cannot back down here.\nI plotted an evil-plan. I created a live Linux Mint bootable USB (that's what I use as my home OS) and told myself\nthat I would install a copy alongside Windows on each machine I sit in every computer lab. Installing Linux Mint\ntakes about 15 minutes on these computers in my lab but it got annoying that I would have to later on also\ninstall the compilers, dependencies and other configuration stuff I make home with. And, also sometimes I would\nfind that someone (other students or staff?) would delete the partition I installed Linux Mint on and thus bring all of\nmy progress back to zero again. I dunno why or who did that but it sucks. It wasn't as if I made Windows unusable on\nthose machines or ate a lot of hard-drive space (30GB isn't really much, ok?) but that was it.\nThis is beyond to what I would have guessed but looking up I found that I could also make a full install Linux Mint\non the flash drive itself. I've never seen a USB with full installed Linux Mint so this was quite interesting and\nI was genuinely surprised when I did this and it worked. I've also tried making a persistent Live Mint bootable\nUSB but it created too many partitions on the USB that it looked ugly and also it didn't offer any login password\nprotection essential for protecting against non-techie people. Also, the internet and my tests say that\na full install on flash drive is faster to boot than a persistent live flash drive. I haven't tested this one\nbut I guess the read/write speed would also probably be a bit faster.\nLater, I realized that a USB with fully installed Linux formatted as Ext4 wouldn't be recognized by Windows\n(unlike persistent live USB, which gets recognized by Windows and allows you to both read &amp; write to the USB). This is a\nproblem because sometimes I have to copy some general documents and maybe print them. Most students are happy\nwith Windows and the printing shops in our campus also are Windows. It would be stupid if my USB wouldn't be\nrecognized on such machines. I could carry around another USB formatted as FAT32 or NTFS but there has to be a\nbetter solution. I thought about creating a multipartioned USB with Linux installed on Ext4 formatted parition\nand another empty partition formatted as FAT32 for Windows to recognize it. However, it turns out that and earlier\nversions of Windows (before Windows 10) would only go through the 1st partition of the USB and mount it if is able\nto properly read that partition. Other partitions are completely ignored irrespective of whether the 1st partition\nis readable by Windows or not. Windows 10 on the other hand has a small improvement that it will iterate on all\nthe available partitions, mount the first one it is able to read correctly and ignore the remaining partitions.\nNevertheless, I formatted the 1st partition as FAT32 with enough space to suffice everyday copy-pasting documents\nand installed on Linux Mint on the 2nd partition with the remaining space. Everything worked fine, I was able to boot\ninto Linux Mint and see the FAT32 partition on Windows. I also like this since unexperienced people who get hold\nof my flash drive would only see the FAT32 partition on Windows and assume that's all the storage the flash drive\nhas to offer while the partition with Linux on it would essentially stay hidden in Windows! Thanks Windows!\nAlso, I have a cheap laptop, the ones that come with a 64-bit processor but a 32-bit UEFI (and no legacy BIOS support).\nI intially created my bootable USB with legacy BIOS since I have yet to find a use for all the fancy features that\nUEFI gives and most machines with 64-bit UEFI also support legacy BIOS boot. Now, if I could get the flash drive to\nboot on my cheap laptop I could be done with this. You see 64-bit processor with 32-bit UEFI can be a pain! Linux\nMint does not officially support for 32-bit UEFI. So far only raw Debian and Fedora does AFAIK. I've heard this is a\nlimitation in the Linux kernel itself, so these OS probably modify the kernel to add support for 32-bit UEFI. Anyway,\nI was able to manually create a UEFI bootable partition on my flash drive USB with the help of this beautifully written guide:\nhttps://medium.com/@realzedgoat/a-sorta-beginners-guide-to-installing-ubuntu-linux-on-32-bit-uefi-machines-d39b1d1961ec\nBUT, turns out that most stuff does not work properly. Sound does not work. Battery percentage won't show up.\nTouchpad gets recognized as a USB mouse, that means no two-finger scrolling or gestures. And sometimes the operating\nsystem just freezes for eternity. Anyway, I'm happy that I made it this far and atleast that my flash drive works perfectly\nfine with legacy BIOS boot and machines with 64-bit architecture and UEFI.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2019/05/31/i-installed-linux-on-my-usb-flash-drive/","title":"I installed Linux on my USB flash drive!"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2019/06/26/modifying-memory-of-a-running-process-in-linux/":{"body":"Everything said in this post is based on my half-understanding of how memory works,\nespecially in Linux. There are certainly going to be parts in this post that are misunderstood\nby me. Don't rely on this post for your homework and take everything in this post with a\ngrain of salt. However, I hope to continue to refine the content in this post as I understand\nmore about how a computer works. Consider this as a disclaimer. That said, let's begin!\nI've been trying out 6502 and x86 Assembly to learn some basic reverse engineering and also\nto learn think in these low-level programming languages, hopefully to understand more of how\neverything works under-the-hood. So I thought what better than to pun some other process's\nmemory. I figured I'll try to modify some stuff assigned to memory by one process from some second\nprocess. I know Windows has tools like Cheat Engine\nwhile Linux has scanmem.\nI still wanted to create my own tiny little program which would be enough to demonstrate how\nthese big tools worked at their heart.\nMost modern Operating Systems have ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)\nturned on\nby default which can help prevent many buffer overflow\nand code injection attacks. These\nattacks if successful could possibly allow the user to gain access to sensitive information\nnot intended for access to the end user. Although, I've tried Cheat Engine and to my knowledge\npopular debuggers still allow for a way to access and modify the disassembled code of a binary\nwhen loaded into memory. They also have a way to watch for code whenever a specified memory\nlocation is accessed by the concerned process, so I'm not completely sure whether these\ndebuggers somehow workaround ASLR or if this completely unrelated. Irrespective of this, to\nmake things not more complicated, we'll already know the address of the memory location we wish\nto modify, as you'll see later.\nFrom now on, let's refer to a primary innocent process as Process A and the secondary process\nwhich attempts to hack into the memory of Process A as Process B. In Linux, we have a system call\nptrace which acts as a middle man between\nProcess B and the memory of Process A. One cannot\ndirectly read or write to the memory of another independent process without ptrace for some\nreason I don't understand. My current guess is that it's there so that a process doesn't\nunintentionally messes up with the memory of some other process. So, if you see someone with ptrace\nit's probably because they ought to either save the world from extinction or be the very cause\nitself. Similar in Windows you have ReadProcessMemory\nand WriteProcessMemory\nfunctions available in Windows API acting as the middle man.\nLet's say we have this simple C code:\n\nAll it does is:\n\n\nAssign a variable a value\n\n\nDisplay the variable's value and its location in memory\n\n\nSleep the main thread for a while\n\n\nDisplay the variable's value and its location in memory again\n\n\nLet's run it:\n\nThis is our Process A. Our goal is to have a Process B change the value of the assigned variable to\nsomething like 20 while the main thread is sleeping. If we succeed, it should show us the value 20\nafter waking up from sleep while the memory location should remain the same.\nI've only tried this on Linux so that's what I'll be talking about. As I mentioned earlier,\nyou need to fire the ptrace system call and you can do that natively via C. So, what we'll\ndo is write another program which will act as Process B. To overwrite the memory of another process\nin Linux, you need to know three things - the PID of the Process A, the memory location to be\nmodified, and obviously the data you need to overwrite with. It's easy to know the PID of a process\nin Linux, and we can know the memory location of the variable since our Process A prints the variable's\nmemory location itself. The data can be anything, I'll use 20 for the purpose of this post.\nHere's how we'll use ptrace:\n\nThe code is pretty self-explanatory - you attach to the process, write data to a memory address and\ndetach.\nAnother thing to take care is that the PID and the memory of any process A are allotted at execution.\nAs far as I know, one cannot predict the PID and where in memory a process will go live, before execution\nof the concerned program. There are probably ways to automate this after the concerned process is\nexecuted but let's avoid complicating the code. So here's our plan, we'll execute the Process A and\nthen we're going to grab its PID manually and update our Process B's source accordingly. Finally,\nwe're going to compile and execute our Process B. If we are fast enough and make it through all\nof this while Process A is in the middle of its sleep, we would have successfully overwritten Process\nA's memory and it should be visible when it wakes up from sleep to display the value!\nLet's do it step wise:\nIn a terminal, run:\n\nYou should get something like this:\n\nThe main thread will now go in sleep mode for another 25 seconds. By executing the program in\nbackground mode, we also get its PID, which in my case is 32555. We could then just call it\nin the foreground with fg. Also, the memory address is 0x7fffcfd52924. Now, we have\neverything we need to call ptrace.\nIn a new terminal, edit process_b.c's variables with what you got from above. For me, I'll replace\nthe variables with:\n\nNow compile and execute the code with:\n\nOnly root can modify another process's memory, so you'll need sudo to run the executable\ngenerated.\nIf everything goes fine and you were able to make it this far while Process A was asleep, you\nshould get output similar to this:\n\nThat's it! Now when Process A completes its sleep: it should look something like this:\n\nYay, The value just got to 20. Awesome!!\nNow if you see the last few lines, you'll notice this weird error I dunno much about:\n\nTurns out I got rid of it by simply assigning a pointer to our variable in Process A.\nWhat I mean is replace:\n\nwith\n\nFor some reason, this works and I no longer smash the stack while hacking into Process A's\nmemory.\nWell, this is the heart of how a memory editor works underneath. One could now imagine\nhow this can scale into bigger beasts like Cheat Engine and scanmem as I talked in the\nfirst paragraph.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2019/06/26/modifying-memory-of-a-running-process-in-linux/","title":"Modifying memory of a running process in Linux"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2020/04/18/installing-popos-on-an-unsupported-32-bit-uefi-hardware/":{"body":"I've been using Linux Mint for quite a while (like past 4 years) and wanted some change.\nPop!_OS seemed another good Ubuntu-based distro so I decided to try it out. However,\nthere is a problem. Since the hardware I use is 32-bit only UEFI without legacy BIOS.\nPop!_OS on the otherhand ships ISOs for use only with 64-bit UEFIs and legacy BIOS (but\ndisregards support for 32-bit UEFI and that's bad since my hardware is 32-bit UEFI only).\nMy laptop is CanvasLapbookL1160, one in baytrail series (Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU  Z3735F @ 1.33GHz).\nIt initially came with Windows 10 without any apparent issues at all, but it ran slow and\nwas, well, Windows. Micromax probably had modified Windows in a way such that it detected\nall hardware peripherals correctly. Since, I had same issues (as I mention later) even if\nI manually re-installed Windows 10, as I did with Linux distros.\n\n  \n  Here's how the machine looks like\n\nI don't really blame the developers for not supporting 32-bit UEFI. This is not just the\ncase with Pop!_OS but with pretty much almost all major distributions out there. I read\nsomewhere that Fedora did support such machines back in 2018, although I'm not sure of what\nthe current status is. 32-bit UEFI machines are pretty rare in 2020 and I understand that\nsupporting such a minority of users is not worth the developer time spent, atleast as of\nnow. The situation was probably different a few years back. The more we wait to support these\ndevices, the lesser sense it makes to support these devices.\nWith what I write here, I expect to document how to get stuff working on such machines in\nthe hope that this would atleast be useful to my future-self and people who are a bit familiar\nwith how Linux works. Move on by assuming that there will sometimes be hardware peripherals\nthat will fail to be recognized properly (such as WiFi, sound output) and random irrecoverable\nfreezes.  I suffer from both these without a solution as of yet. I also happen to be hit by\nsome other unexplained stuff as I'll mention later. Anyway, since I'm writing all of this\nfrom memory, expect some very specific details to lack in precision.\nLinux Mint (2 years ago)\nTwo years back when I installed Linux Mint 19 on this same hardware, the situation wasn't\nas bad as it is now. You'd use dd or cat from coreutils or specialized tools such as\nRufus or UNetbootin to write the ISO image on to a USB device. When trying to boot this USB\ndevice on a 32-bit UEFI machine you'd notice that it won't even show up as a boot device.\nAt this point, the first response would be to put a bootia32.efi in /efi/boot/ on your\nEFI partition on your USB stick. However, if you wrote the ISO image on the USB in dd-mode\n(as termed in Rufus) (that is using dd or cat or dd-mode in Rufus) you now won't be\nable to add or remove files from your USB stick since the USB stick would be stuck in\nread-only mode. I haven't come across a way to make it writable again except completely\nformatting it in such a case.\nUEFI firmware looks for all FAT formatted partitions and attempts to look for boot files\nstored in /EFI/boot under these partitions. Now what cat, dd and Rufus do is to create\none FAT32 partition for UEFI boot and another one as ext4 for core image files. This is\nbecause of the way how it is actually defined in most distro ISOs. I've found an easier way to\nkeep the disk writable and avoid such utilities is to create a single FAT32 partition\nconsisting of both the boot and core image files.\nSo let's only maintain a single partition making things a little easier. I'd first locally mount\nthe ISO image and then simply copy-paste the mounted files on to a USB stick which has been\nfirst formatted as FAT32.\nThe USB stick will still be writable at this point and you can now copy bootia32.efi to\n/EFI/boot/ as previously mentioned. With this I was successfully be able to boot into live\nLinux Mint from my USB stick. At this point, one should notice all the hardware stuff that\nfails to be recognized. Some things to think of: whether battery percentage reduces when not\nplugged-in?  If charger plugged-in display indicator shows correctly? WiFi works? Brightness\ncontrols?  Sound output from speakers and 3.5mm jack? Is trackpad being detected as an external\nmouse (that means no two-finger scrolling and \"disable mouse when typing\" does not work)? Does\ndeep-sleep work? If you're hitting some of these issues, I've mostly had more luck with\nlearning to live with them than looking for solutions on the Internet.\nIt might be possible to write a custom driver or a kernel module to fix an issue but that's\nbeyond me.  In any case, you'd normally select the partition where you want to install Linux\nMint and make sure that you create and EFI partition with ~200MB if it doesn't already exist,\nand next, next. Everything would go fine until at the end of the installation it mentions\nthat it failed to install a boot loader. You could now reboot and see that our newly installed\nLinux Mint isn't available in the boot menu! I know of two ways to fix this from here:\nMethod 1\nYou'd reboot your machine when the failure message pops up. Now you'd again select your\nbootable USB drive, but this time go to advanced options and it should mention something\nabout accessing the GRUB command-line by pressing c key on the keyboard. Do that and it\nwill drop us to a shell. Here we'll attempt to manually load the kernel image and the initial\nRAM disk. The first step is to recognize the drive and partition where you installed Linux\nMint to. This can be done by using ls:\n\n  \n  The GRUB command-line\n\n\nOnce you've recognized your drive and partition, note its UUID by running ls -l:\n\nThe UUID is the the alphanumeric characters such as in the above case, the UUID is:\n46868037-2224-4887-adfe-d1db9fe93366. Sometimes ls might not accept the -l parameter.\nIn such a case, omit root=UUID=6868037-2224-4887-adfe-d1db9fe93366 from the below command.\nNow, we load the kernel image with:\n\nreplace the above alphanumerics with your obtained UUID.\nNow load the initial RAM disk:\n\nThe filenames may not exactly be vmlinuz.efi or initrd.gz but should closely resemble\nthem. So, try loading whatever seems the closest filename to you.\nNow do\n\nIf your ls didn't support -l option and you omitted the UUID, the kernel will fail\nto load and will drop you into a busybox shell which can now be used to read the all the\nconnected devices UUIDs by running:\n\nIf still not sure here what device and partition you installed Linux Mint, try mkdir\nand mount the device files from /dev/sdXY on to this directory and then ls. Either\nway you should now have the correct UUID. Click a picture of it or note it down and\nrepeat the above mentioned steps but now by entering the UUID when loading the kernel\nimage.\nIt would now successfully boot into the installed Linux Mint and now we fix the boot menu\nso it shows up in the boot menu.\n\nCheck which partition on your hard drive is your EFI partition. I'd assume /dev/sda2\nhere:\n\nUpdate the menus:\n\nIf you get the command-not-found error on update-grub, run this instead:\n\nEverything should be fixed now. Reboot and check your boot menu.\nThis is a guide\nthat was immensly helpful to me back when I was new to this stuff and installing\nLinux Mint, so you should notice some similarities above and in the mentioned guide.\nMethod 2\nThat was the first way, but in such a case today I'll probably use this method.\nThe second way of fixing this boot menu is via chroot.\nWhen Linux Mint errors on saying that the bootloader failed to install. Do not reboot.\nOr if you did reboot, boot back into the live USB again.  Now open a terminal and\ncheck where the new Linux Mint got installed. I'd assume in /dev/sda3. Do this:\n\nNow you run the commands mentioned in the 1st method starting from the apt install grub-efi-ia32-bin\npart in the chroot jail. Ok, should be fixed after that's done. Reboot and check.\nAt this point, I'd be able to normally boot into my installed Linux Mint. However, you'd see\nthose hardware peripherals that didn't work in the live boot don't work here either. That's\nexpected. However, my hardware has yet another problem. If I upgrade my kernel version to 4.17\nor anything later (I've randomly tried versions upto 5.6), my input devices such as keyboard\nand mouse won't be detected, and the USB ports aren't supplied power. The last kernel version\nthat atleast allows me to keep the machine usable is 4.16.18. However, I still face other\nissues with 4.16.18 and lower versions of kernel. These issues include - trackpad offers no\n2-finger scroll or middle click capability. It simply works as a 2-button mouse. Battery\nis always stuck at 50% and shows no plugged-in indicator. There were other things as I've\nmentioned in here.\nOkay, that's for the Linux Mint part from 2 years ago.\nPop!_OS\nI was able to successfully get Pop!_OS 19.10 working. Although, the kernel still suffers from the\nsame issues I mentioned in the last paragraph. Getting Pop!_OS to work was harder in comparision\nto Linux Mint. I'd normally download the ISO and copy the files on my USB stick on a FAT32\nformatted partition. I've noticed that Pop!_OS contains some core image files that symlink to\nother directories in the image and FAT systems doesn't support symlinks. So, in such a case\nI'd create a complete copy of the file/directory and replace that by its corresponding symlink.\nDone that. Now it doesn't show up in the boot menu? Ok, put in a bootia32.efi. However,\nsimply doing this didn't succeed this time, it kept getting stuck somewhere along doing casper-prefetch\nwhile loading the kernel and would then drop me into a busybox shell, as I could see on my screen.\nThis USB did boot up on other my other machine with a 64-bit UEFI. So on such a machine, I checked\nthe default kernel version that Pop!_OS comes with using:\n\nwhen live booting the USB on a 64-bit UEFI. It was 5.3.\nThis was higher than the maximum kernel version my 32-bit UEFI hardware is known to work with\n(4.16.18).\nI guessed that the reason it failed to boot on my 32-bit UEFI hardware was simply the\nunsupported kernel version having a hard time determining stuff on my machine. I tried to get an\nolder version of kernel up with Pop!_OS. So going with that, I attempted to replace vmlinuz (the kernel image) and\ninitrd (initial RAM disk) files that come by default in Pop!_OS's ISO, with their older versions respectively\nfrom the installed Linux Mint (/boot/vmlinuz and /boot/initrd) which is currently living in my hard disk\n(the one I talked about in the previous section).  Although I don't remember what error it came up\nwith after the replacement when the kernel was being initialized, only that it didn't work. I thought\nperhaps there is a difference between these files in a live USB and the ones from a fully-installed\nLinux. So, I attempted to replace the kernel image and initial RAM disk image again, but this\ntime from a Linux Mint 19 ISO image which by default comes with a kernel version &lt; 4.17, that means the\nkernel from such an ISO image would work with my hardware. A good friend of mine had a Linux Mint 19 ISO image\nlaying around. so I asked him to send me the needed vmlinuz and initrd files from his ISO. I\nreplaced them with what came with Pop!_OS and attempted to boot again. It still didn't work.\nI had another idea. I had an extra USB stick and I live booted Pop!_OS on a 64-bit UEFI and\ninstalled it on to this extra USB stick. Make sure the partition size you create for the full-usb\ninstallation is smaller than the space you wish to allocate when in future you install it onto\nyour actual hard drive parition (this will be useful later in the post). The installation was a\nsuccess on this 64-bit UEFI machine. I wanted to be convinced whether it was the kernel version\nissue that caused failure to boot on my 32-bit UEFI. I plugged the USB with fully-installed\nPop!_OS which I just made (not the one with live!) into my 32-bit UEFI machine. I already had\nLinux Mint installed on the machine, so I went into the GRUB command-line by pressing c key\nwhile on the advanced boot options.  I determined the UUID of the USB stick which contained the\nfull-install of Pop!_OS using ls -l on the available disks. Next, I loaded the kernel and initial\nRAM disk from my Linux Mint and set the root partition pointing towards my fully-installed Pop!_OS\nUSB. If everything went fine I'd be using the kernel version from my Linux Mint but the root partition\nwould be set to Pop!_OS meaning that I would essentially be running Pop!_OS with my\nhardware-supported kernel. I did this in GRUB command-line: (Assume (hd0,gpt3) to be my Linux Mint\ninstallation partition. Also replace the UUID below with what you got from ls -l above)\n\nAnd it worked! I was now in my USB with full-install of Pop!_OS running an older kernel version!\nWiFi and sound didn't work here since I believe the kernel was attempting to load modules from\nPop!_OS's partition and there were none present for this kernel version in there. So, I booted\nback into my Linux Mint and chrooted into Pop!_OS's full-installed USB stick. The kernel version\nI wanted wasn't available in default apt repositories so I downloaded the\nnecessary packages myself which were:\n\nand installed all these packages with dpkg -i onto my chrooted Pop!_OS.\nNext to see if this older kernel did install as expected I rebooted and went into GRUB\ncommand-line: ((hd1,gpt2) is my fully-installed Pop!_OS USB stick and the one I chrooted into\nin previous step)\n\nOk, boot was successful. WiFi and sound is working too! With all this, I think I was right in\nguessing that it was the newer kernel version that came by default with Pop!_OS that my hardware\ncouldn't handle it. Either way, I still had to get Pop!_OS installed onto my main hard disk.\nThe problem was still that I couldn't get the live USB to boot on my 32-bit UEFI machine\neven if I replaced the kernel image and initial RAM disk image.\nHowever, we don't need to do that now! I believed that now I could simply dd or cat the\nfully-installed Pop!_OS partition from my USB stick onto my hard disk's partition, and then fix\nup my boot menus.  This should act similar to the way as if I installed Pop!_OS onto my hard\ndisk from a live USB.  So, I booted into Mint backed up anything I needed. Backups done, I then\ntook another USB stick (the third one) and wrote an image from the full-usb installed to this\nthird USB stick:\n(/dev/sdb2 is your fully-installed USB)\n\nNow then I booted into my fully-installed Pop!_OS USB and wrote this image onto my Linux Mint\npartition. I wanted to replace Linux Mint with Pop!_OS so I chose the same partition, you choose\na different one if you wish to keep Mint:\n(/dev/sda3 is my hard disk partition I want to write Pop!_OS over to)\n\nThis should kill my Mint installation and replace it with Pop!_OS. Now we need to fix up the\nboot menu so this Pop!_OS shows up in the boot menu. Do not reboot and instead first chroot\ninto hard disk partition where you wrote the image:\n(/dev/sda2 here is my hard disk's EFI partition)\n\nUpdate the menus:\n\nIf you get the command-not-found error on update-grub, run this instead:\n\nThat is all! You should now be able to reboot, disconnect all attached USB sticks and Pop!_OS\nshould show up in your hard disk's boot menu! Try booting it! Although I still face the same\naftermath issues as I did in Linux Mint.\nUpdate: I was able to atleast fix my freezing issue from here https://askubuntu.com/a/796484/694881.\nThis seems to be an issue in lower kernel versions. Like the linked answer mentions, I had to\nappend intel_idle.max_cstate=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT section in /etc/default/grub.\nAnd then update my boot configuration:\n\nWhoa. This freezing issue seems to be specific to baytrail machines. There has been a kernel bug\nreport filed on https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109051\nwith a very good number of people affected! Reading the responses, it looks like Intel has been\nmessing things up. I'm at this also pretty sure the other issues I face are specific to baytrail too.\nEnd\nThis is how it had to be done on my laptop. It is very unlikely that the same exact procedure\nwould work as it is on a different machine and for a different OS. So, it is important to understand\nwhat's going on above. I'll probably forget this stuff soon too so I just wanted to throw this in\nsomewhere as soon as possible.\nI know that 4.16.18 is a pretty old kernel but I'd still be willing for the compromise with using\nit than having stayed put with the Windows that came pre-installed with this machine.\nTL;DR Do not a get yourself a baytrail machine if you can avoid it.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2020/04/18/installing-popos-on-an-unsupported-32-bit-uefi-hardware/","title":"Installing Pop!_OS on an unsupported 32-bit UEFI hardware"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2020/06/30/poor-mans-usb-sound-card/":{"body":"Consider a situation where a Linux desktop is missing or has a broken 3.5mm audio jack.

I've been working with the\nMetaBrainz Foundation on extending the Rust wrapper around\nthe MusicBrainz Web-API, named musicbrainz_rs.\nFor all the folks who have no idea what MusicBrainz is -\nMusicBrainz is an openly accessible database maintained by the community, which contains\nrecords on music metadata. If you've ever worked with the Spotify Web-API, you'll know\nyou can make API calls to access information on some of the metadata on artists, albums\nand songs that Spotify exposes. MusicBrainz has been built on the same idea with a laser\nfocus only on music metadata (unlike Spotify, where you can also control music playback\nthrough their API) and offers a lot more detail on this metadata compared to other\nservices like Spotify.\nAccessing the metadata\nYou can go right now and explore this metadata through their web search!\nFor the context, let's say we look up on the music artist Green Day, we'll get to the artist's page,\nneatly showcasing the albums that the artist has released. If you look at this page's URL,\nyou'll notice this long alphanumeric string - 084308bd-1654-436f-ba03-df6697104e19. This is\nthe artist's MBID (short for MusicBrainz ID). MusicBrainz supports many entities\nand every entity is associated with a unique MBID. So, every artist, track, or any other\nentity in MusicBrainz is associated with a unique MBID.\nYou can even download the complete database onto your local disk from\nhere, anytime!\nThe Web-API\nMusicBrainz also offers a Web-API to\nprogramatically access this metadata. Let's say to access metadata for the artist Green Day\nthrough the API, you'll need to know the artist's MBID (which we already have from the\nlast section) and then make a GET request to the endpoint:\nhttps://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/084308bd-1654-436f-ba03-df6697104e19\nYou'll notice that we're missing a lot of information here compared to what we saw in the web\ninterface in the last section. This is because the API returns minimal information by default.\nYou need to pass additional parameters to access any further information.\nLet's say to also access the artist's albums (which is termed as release-groups in MusicBrainz) -\nwe pass ?inc=release-groups when making the request:\nhttps://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/084308bd-1654-436f-ba03-df6697104e19?inc=release-groups\nSee Subqueries for the complete list\nof supported parameters. There are many more things that you can do through the Web-API (see the API documentation).\nI won't be covering them here.\nLanguage libraries\nPeople have created library wrappers around the Web-API for many programming languages. The list\nof recognized of libraries can be found here,\nand this is where I come in. This summer, I've been working on one such library for the Rust\nprogramming language, named musicbrainz_rs.\nFor example, you can make queries using musicbrainz_rs this way:\n\nmusicbrainz_rs isn't listed as a recognized library by MusicBrainz, since the library does\nnot completely wrap around the Web-API at the moment. Off the top of my head, we're mainly missing\non Non-MBID Lookups, Search and Submitting Data.\nThere are also parts of the library that need to be addressed before it being suitable for use in\nproduction. Anyway, I've been working with Paul (creator of musicbrainz_rs) to build new features in the library.\nWe've had some cool things going on since the last month, which I'll talk about in the next sections!\nCoverart\n\nThe library can now fetch for coverart for the release and release-group entities. An\nexample covering all of these methods can be found in - fetch_release_coverart.rs.\n\n\nAuto-retries\n\nThe library will now auto-retry on queries failed due to rate-limiting by the MusicBrainz\nservers. In case of a failed query due to rate-limiting, we're returned with the time duration in the\nresponse header until the next query would be accepted the MusicBrainz servers. The library\nnow automatically sleeps the current thread for this received duration and retries the\nquery by default. The default is set to 2 retries per failed query and this can be changed with:\n\n\n\nWe've also previously had trouble running our test-suite due to this. Our test-suite is\nconstantly making queries to MusicBrainz servers and the queries would start to fail after\na while. So we had ugly hacks in-place to get our test-suite to pass. We had introduced\na one second sleep in our test-suite after every call to the MusicBrainz servers to not trigger\ntheir rate-limitations, and this had been greatly increasing our test-suite run times. I'm glad\nthis is no longer the case after introducing auto-retries!\n\n\nRelationship Includes\n\n\nI mentioned earlier about how we can request for additional information when making queries\nby passing the ?inc= subquery parameter. Relationship includes can be considered as one such\ncategory of parameters that can be passed to ?inc=.\n\n\nI've been involved with refactoring the already implemented subquery include parameters\nand further implemented the relationship include parameters. This involved some manual\nwork on my part to figure out what include parameters are accepted by what entities\n(since this doesn't seem to have been documented in the docs\nand I couldn't find it anywhere else either). Anyway, requests to relationship\nincludes can now be made simliar to how subquery includes are requested for:\n\n\n(This hasn't been merged into the main codebase yet, we'll get there soon!) We're there now!\n\n\n\nThis is fun!\nI've been enjoying so far. This GSoC has given me a chance to extend the reaches of MusicBrainz\nto Rust and also get better at writing Rust code, something that I've always been excited about\never since I first tried it out. :P\nI'm happy I got this opportunity.

I didn't want to get too fancy\nand most bulbs that just do the job have a cloud server acting as middle-man between the bulb and its\ncorresponding mobile app, which sounds really uncomfortable.\nI came to know about Tasmota while looking for bulbs that work over\nlocal network and don't have to depend on a 3rd party's cloud server. Looking around for such bulbs, it seems\nbulbs with pre-installed Tasmota aren't as common, especially with local vendors. One of the few I stumbled\nupon was Athom Bulbs but these would come out to be pretty expensive considering\nimport duties and all. Nope, won't work.\nResearching a bit more, I came across tuya-convert for ESP\nmicro-controllers. So, it seems like most bulbs which connect over the 3rd party cloud are based on Tuya but\nre-branded, and most Tuya based bulbs if not all use some kinda ESP micro-controller to communicate to the\nGPIOs and connect to WiFi. These Tuya based devices seemed to have a vulnerability in the past where you\ncould install a custom firmware over-the-air and take it off the 3rd party cloud. This vulnerability seems\nto have been fixed by Tuya as of 2020 and the newer devices need to ripped apart and have to be connected\nvia serial port through the RX/TX GPIO pins present on the micro-controller to install a custom firmware.\nHowever, there are still re-branded Tuya devices around as 2022 that have this vulnerability.\nI started to look for never-heard-of-before brands on local retailer websites, since it felt like those would\nbe based on Tuya, as well as pre-loaded with a vulnerable firmware. And it seems I did get lucky\nwith this $5 RGB Bulb.\n\nInstallation\nOn receiving the bulb, the box in which the bulb came in was branded by JBT, while the one on the retailer's\nwebsite mentioned ONTUBE. It wasn't problem to me since specifications seemed to match on paper. A few things\nI found interesting was that the mobile app's UI that the manual mentioned to install\n(Lumary) seemed awfully similar\nto Smart Life which is pretty\npopluar with Tuya based devices! This and along with how the bulb entered into pairing mode (ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON)\nseems to be in-sync with Tuya. At this point, I was almost certain the bulb's based on Tuya.\nI was careful to not feed in my WiFi's SSID anywhere on the mobile app as I've read around that Tuya devices\ntend to auto-update their firmware on the smell of Internet, which would be a problem if the bulb updated to\na not-vulnerable firmware.\nLooking more into how I can experiment with tuya-convert, it seemed like installing it on my native machine\nisn't a good idea as it tends to mess up with network settings to get up working. I have a Raspberry Pi\nZero W around which I loaded up with fresh Raspberry Pi OS off the Internet as a means to not having to mess\nwith my native machine.\nThis method had a slight problem as I use my Pi in headless mode and I won't be able\nto stay connected via SSH if tuya-convert messes up with Pi's network settings. I worked around this by\nsetting up my Pi to be usable as an Ethernet gadget which can be done by adding dtoverlay=dwc2 to Pi's\n/boot/config.txt (make sure to comment out any previous lines with dtoverlay) and appending modules-load=dwc2,g_ether\nto Pi's /boot/cmdline.txt. Now connecting through the micro-USB data port on the Pi to my native machine with USB A,\nand changing Ethernet network settings on my native machine to \"Shared to other computers\" should show a new\nEthernet interface on your native machine when the Pi boots up. If you also entered a WiFi SSID, then you can SSH\ninto the Pi and get the IP address our Pi got assigned on the USB gadget interface from running hostname -I.\nThen you can reconnect SSH using this USB gadget interface's IP address.\nTuya-convert can now have the built-in WiFi all for itself. Following the steps to use tuya-convert:\n\nIt worked out fine and now I have Tasmota on my bulb!\nThis means the bulb I received was pre-loaded with a vulnerable firmware.\nChecking out the backups directory created by tuya-convert, the bulb seems to be using ESP8266 chip.\nSave the .bin file for your firmware somewhere in case you decide to revert back to stock firmware.\nHowever, reverting back to stock firmware only seems possible by ripping the bulb apart and connecting\nto a serial console.\nI found out my bulb's IP and experimented with Tasmota's web interface a bit. I also updated Tasmota to\nthe current latest version (v12.1.1) while I was at it.\n\nModule and Template Configuration\nTasmota is a generic firmware and it doesn't know what GPIO pins on the ESP microcontroller should do what.\nHeck it doesn't even know whether the device is a switch, fan, bulb or something else.\nIt needs to be explicitly stated what GPIO pins need to do what. If you're luckier you can find a pre-existing\ntemplate compatible with your device from https://templates.blakadder.com/\nor get some leads checking around the Internet.\nIn my case, I couldn't find a fully compatible template as is. However, I stumbled upon\nthis gist\nwhich gave me a headstart on figuring out the pins. I copied the template code and pasted it in my Tasmota UI\nin \"Configuration -&gt; Configure Other\" and restarted my bulb. Turns out it required a few changes such as the\ncolor bar on the Tasmota UI was giving me different colors than what it should have, but at least now I knew\nthat some of the pins from the template serve some function (albeit different) on the same pins on my bulb.\n\n  \n  Color Changer on Tasmota\n\nThis template showed up for manual configuration in \"Configuration -&gt; Configure Module\".\nOn checking Tasmota's docs on different lights, it seems\nif only one of the pin is set to PWM while all others are set to None, this only pin will allow for brightness\ncontrol.\nExperimenting with this; I figured if I set some pin to PWM1 while setting all the other pins to None. If\nrestarting the bulb and moving the brightness slider on the UI emits and changes brightness only for the\nRed color, then this pin corresponds to the R channel in the RGB combination. If the pin only emits and allows\ncontrol for white color, then move on to the next pin since it's not a part of the RGB combination.\nI made a note of what pin emits the Red color. Proceeding further, I set this Red pin back to None and continued\nthe process to find pins responsible for emitting Green and then for Blue colors. Once I had the RGB pins\nfigured out individually, I set all of them together to their corresponding PWM number as stated in the above\nlinked docs, which is:\n\nand voila now Tasmota's UI had the RGB color bar show up and work as expected!\nExperimenting further with the unused GPIO pins, it seems like the bulb also supports Cold White and Warm White\n(check the docs what they mean!) which is really a nice bonus to have!\nI'm not sure of the purpose of Template Configuration and if it would have been helpful for my case. Nonetheless,\nI copied my Module Configuration over to my Template Configuration as well.\n\n  \n  Final Configuration\n\nLast thing I noticed was the bulb wouldn't retain its last colors and would stay off when powered off and powered on\nback. This was resolved after executing following commands under Tasmota:\n\nThere's ClapLights that goes well along with it!\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2022/10/04/flashing-tasmota-on-a-tuya-based-bulb/","title":"Flashing Tasmota on a Tuya based Bulb"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2022/11/05/flashing-tasmota-on-lctech-4ch-relay/":{"body":"It seems we mostly require three components to put up non-smart home lights and other home electronics on a network:\n\nRelay\nA microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities\nAC to DC converter (to supply power to the microcontroller and relay)\n\n\n  \n  LC Tech 5V 4CH Relay\n\nThis relay has all other components except for a built-in AC to DC converter.

The ESP8266 module is just used as a WiFi interface with its default AT firmware. The two chips are using serial (115200-8-1) to communicate.\nThe original user experience is pretty clunky and no really usable. On power up, the board start an access point you need to connect your phone to in order to send commands. This is only usefull for testing as it's isolated from your main network.\nTo switch to station mode, you need to push a button on the board (S1), install an app on your phone and then use this app to feed your SSID and password to the board.

No HTTP, no protocol of any kind, just plain binary.\nFor example, you can run this command from Linux to switch on the first relay :\n\nThere is no way to get a feedback of the current state of the relay (beside looking at the leds on the board).\nOn power loss, the board switch back to access point and you have to push the S1 button again to reconnect.\n\nWiring up\nThere are some most commonly used scenarios when wiring up the ESP-01S using a USB to TTL adapter:\n\n  \n  USB to TTL adapter\n\nRuns the program present in flash:\n| ESP-01S \t| USB to TTL \t|\n|---------\t|------------\t|\n| 3V3     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| GND     \t| GND        \t|\nRuns the program present in flash and gain access to the serial console:\n| ESP-01S \t| USB to TTL \t|\n|---------\t|------------\t|\n| 3V3     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| GND     \t| GND        \t|\n| RX     \t| TX        \t|\n| TX     \t| RX        \t|\nSerial console can now be accessed using picocom:\n\nESP-01S uses the default baud rate of 76800 to display boot messages.

Experiment with\nthese common baud rates used with ESP-01S if you're not sure of the expected baud rate:\n9600\n14400\n19200\n115200\nIf you're still getting garbled data, you'll have to do some research on the baud rate used by the firmware\ncurrently flashed on the microcontroller.\nBooting into Flash Mode:\n| ESP-01S \t| USB to TTL \t|\n|---------\t|------------\t|\n| 3V3     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| GND     \t| GND        \t|\n| EN     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| IO0     \t| GND        \t|\nYou'll have to make a few connections in parallel to boot into this mode. A breadboard might help.\nAlso there's no point booting into flash mode when you can't read and write to the flash. So, this mode is usually\npaired up with RX/TX connections.\nBooting into Flash Mode with access to Serial Console:\n| ESP-01S \t| USB to TTL \t|\n|---------\t|------------\t|\n| 3V3     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| GND     \t| GND        \t|\n| EN     \t| 3V3        \t|\n| IO0     \t| GND        \t|\n| RX     \t| TX        \t|\n| TX     \t| RX        \t|\n\n  \n  \n  Wiring up to boot into Flash Mode with access to Serial Console\n  \n\nIf you like, you can also make the following connection:\n| ESP-01S \t| USB to TTL \t|\n|---------\t|------------\t|\n| RST     \t| GND        \t|\nPlug in and out the RST jumper cable whenever you want to hard reset/reboot your chip (this won't erase the\nflash memory). If you don't setup this RST connection, I think re-plugging the 3V3 pin should have the same effect\n(happy to accept PR if you have an ESP-01S around at the moment to confirm).\n\n  \n  Connecting to pins on the relay board\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Connecting to pins directly on the ESP8266 ESP-01S\n  \n  (Ignore the Pi Pico in above pics)\n\nNow you should be able to read and write programs to flash memory. Let's start by taking a dump of what's already\npresent on the flash memory using esptool.py:\n\nThis will backup the first 1 MB from the flash memory. If you're using any other chip besides ESP-01S that has\na different flash size, adjust 0x100000 accordingly (e.g. set it to 0x400000 if chip has a flash size of 4 MB).\nFlashing a custom firmware\nRemoteRelay\nI first flashed the chip with RemoteRelay as it it's made specifically\nfor LC Tech Relays. You can compile and flash it using Arudino IDE. However,\nthis firmware had an issue where it won't save the last relay state if the chip were to be rebooted. All relays\nwould be set to OFF state after a reboot. This causes a problem that peripherals connected in relay under NO\nwould always start as OFF and peripherals connected in relay under NC would always start as ON whenever the\npower goes off and comes back on, irrespective of the last relay state. Also, if you want to integrate RemoteRelay\nwith HomeAssistant, you'll have to manually add API endpoints.\nTasmota\nNext I went with Tasmota mostly in an attempt to load relay's last state in case of power reset that didn't seem\npossible with RemoteRelay. Digging a bit, one way that worked for me is to compile Tasmota (using\ntasmota-docker) with support for if logic conditions:\n\n\nThis will output a .bin we can use to flash on the chip.\nLet's erase the flash on the chip:\n\nand now write the generated .bin onto the chip:\n\nConnect the ESP-01S back to the relay and power it on.\nNow to make the ESP8266 communicate with the seconday chip which controls the actual realys, we'll\nadd some serial commands in Tasmota GUI. Applying the configuration and setting up rules from the 12V variant\nseems to also work for my 5V variant:\nhttps://templates.blakadder.com/LC-ESP01-4R-12V.html\nNow to save and load relay's last state, create another rule:\n\nAnd enable it with:\n\nThe rules in the linked template and loading/saving statesmake sense if you connect all your peripherals to NO\non the relays.\nIf you'll be connecting all of them to NC, swap State=0 with State=1 and vice-versa in both rules like below:\n\nMake sure to enable both these rules:\n\nIf you noticed above in rule2, for some reason I had to repeat the last line:\n\notherwise Tasmota 12.2.0.2 didn't seem to pick it up.\nStill need to verify if it's me messing something up or if this seems a bug in Tasmota.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2022/11/05/flashing-tasmota-on-lctech-4ch-relay/","title":"Flashing Tasmota on LC Tech 5V 4CH Relay"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/06/12/capturing-and-piping-audio-output-from-a-process-in-linux/":{"body":"I've been looking to intercept audio data from specific processes so I can tinker with this audio\ndata in real time. Vaguely capture audio output from a process, tinker with it, and play\nthis tinkered audio through my hardware, something similar to this pseudocode:\n\nI think I got something pretty close to this figured here.\nA little while ago, I moved to PipeWire from PulseAudio.\nThe stuff below will only work if you're using PipeWire yourself. It might also be possible to\nadjust this to work with PulseAudio but it isn't something I'm looking to explore at the moment.\nSetup\nThe plan is to create a new virtual audio output device. We'll be redirecting the audio\noutput from our target process to this virtual audio output device, so that we're able to isolate\nthis process's audio output from all other processes. We'll then capture all audio data being\nsent to this virtual output device. Once captured, we can tinker with the audio data and then\nredirect this tinkered audio output to our actual audio output device(s).\nWe'll begin by inserting a kernel module to create a virtual audio loopback device:\n\nWe should now see two new virtual audio devices: Analog Output and Analog Input.\n\n  \n  Audio Devices\n\nLaunch some application, say Spotify desktop, put some music on, and have Spotify send the audio data\nto this new virtual audio output Analog Output.\nIn Manjaro, I got it working as in the screenshot below, but it should be similar\non other distros (try looking for it under Settings -&gt; Audio), or install and use pavucontrol gui.\nHaven't looked around for a CLI alternative for this purpose yet.\n\n  \n  Switching playback device to virtual output device\n\nOnce you switch the audio output device for Spotify to the dummy output device, you'll no longer\nhear your music from your actual speakers.\nNow let's see the node names given by PipeWire to our currently existing audio devices.\n\n(pw-* commands are only available with PipeWire)\nAfter some speculation, I figured out my dummy audio output device is called alsa_output.platform-snd_aloop.0.analog-stereo\nand my actual audio output device is called alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3-platform-skl_hda_dsp_generic.HiFi__hw_sofhdadsp__sink.\nConfirm yours by running any of the following commands (added all that I figured out in the moment\nhere for documenting purpose) to redirect audio from your dummy audio output device to your actual\naudio output device.

We can now mess with this audio. As an example, we'll attempt to increase sample rate for\nwhatever's playing in Spotify to make it sound nightcorish:\n\nAt the time of writing, pw-record captures audio at a sample rate of 44.8KHz. In the above example\nwe resampled it to 52KHz (-r 52000). Since we'll be playing audio at a higher sample rate than what we'll be\nreceiving from pw-record, our dummy audio output will have to play catch up with our actual audio\noutput. This means our actual audio output will stutter every now and then.\nAs a little workaround, we passed -B 5000000 to let Spotify fill up the audio buffer for 5s everytime\nit starts to play catch up after which aplay would attempt to begin resampling.\nWe can also do multiple pipes for a bit more complexy stuff:\n\n\nSynchronizing audio output from a process to multiple machines\nA few years ago, I wrote a post on synchronizing multimedia plaback (and Syncplay).\nQuite a while after writing it, I discovered Snapcast which is\nmore tailored to audio syncing and seems to work better than Syncplay in that regard.\n(although, I'll still stick to Syncplay for video syncing stuff)\nInstall Snapcast and edit /etc/snapserver.conf to have your source line as:\n\nLaunch the Snapcast server:\n\nIn another terminal, we'll write the audio output from the dummy audio output device to this named pipe\nwhich'll be used by snapcast server to broadcast audio to connected clients:\n\nHave some application writing audio output to this dummy audio output device (Spotify as we talked about\nin the previous section, anything else works fine too).\nSnapcast server by default also provides a little built-in client running on http://0.0.0.0:1780, you\ncan open this in a browser (which'll be writing audio output to our actual audio output device) and tap\nthe play button. If you're able to hear music now, then we're good to go!\nSnapcast client app is also available for Android and iOS.

Isn't the major point about owning a Yubikey is to make online passwords a physical problem?\nThere seems to be a consensus (for good reasons) to have at least one offsite backup whenever possible for\nmost things holding digital value, be it storage backups (3-2-1 backup strategy at the least) or Yubikeys.\nThere's a problem with this, how to keep the offsite backups up to date with our primary media?\nFor storage media, having an offsite server running a backup service like\nborg or kopia over the network seems\na decent choice.\nBut what about keeping the Yubikey up to date in an offsite location?\nI've read some people use Yubikeys as a passkey or as a 2FA method to their password manager. So if we've\ngot the offsite Yubikey setup as authentication method to unlock our password manager's vault beforehand,\nthen we should be able to store any other sensitive stuff later on inside of our password manager, as the\noffsite Yubikey would only need to unlock our password manager's vault to give us back access to everything.\nIf our password manager supports it, we can also store passkeys digitally for other services inside our\npassword manager, and have our Yubikey act as the master passkey to unlock our vault.\nThis is nice and in this case, people for the most part don't have to go through the hoops in order to keep\ntheir offsite Yubikey synced up, because they don't need to.\nHaving an offsite Yubikey makes sense to me. But how prepared would we be to retrieve the offsite Yubikey\nwhen a calamity (a Tsunami?) ensues and:\n\n\nDestroys our primary site and we lose access to not only our primary Yubikeys but also our home,\nmobile phones, paper money, and even access to the city's vehicular transport system; each of which seems\nto significantly multiply the difficulty in order for us to physically retrieve the offsite Yubikey.\n\n\nIn an extreme scenario, we happen to be unfortunate enough to hit our fleshy human heads on concrete\n(memory loss) during the disaster unfolding, or fail to make it out at all.\n\n\nFor the 2nd point, life support should preceed everything else. I think it's nice to have an offsite\nexecutor,\na trusty someone who could take their time to help us with our digital stuff as we start to gain back sense\nof self-awareness, or otherwise give the digital us a closure if we're no longer around.\nIn scenarios similar to 1st point, where we lose our possessions but happen to be physically okay enough,\nand want to gain back access to our digital vaults; physically retrieving the offsite Yubikey may not always\nsound like a plan.\nWhat I think might work in such scenarios would be to have a trusty person under the same roof where the\noffsite Yubikey lives. We can share this offsite Yubikey over to us through the Internet in our SOS situation,\nand have our trustypie person finger tap authenticate the Yubikey for us. This way, the offsite Yubikey should\nstill partially get to keep its job to make online passwords a physical problem, while also being useful to us\nremotely.\nDoin' it!\nI tried plugging in a Yubikey into my Raspberry Pi located in an (imaginary) offsite location and setting up USB\nsharing to my primary machine using USB/IP; seems a good enough way\nto me. The linked arch wiki page should be a good starting point.\nHere's what I had to do on my Raspberry Pi (server):\n\nAnd on my primary arch machine (client):\n\nOnce setup, my primary machine works as if the remote Yubikey is physically connected to it.\nYou can try it out by doing something that'll invoke the Yubikey for authentication. As of writing, it looks\nlike USB/IP sends unencrypted data over TCP which could be a security concern. So you'd probably want to\nsetup a VPN and make USB/IP connections over it securely (tailscale\nis fun).\n\nThere could be more implications behind the entire idea, as well as setting up something like this.\nIt'll be wise to research more before pushing something like this into production.\n\nBlub/netevent\nI wrote about Blub/netevent in\none of my earlier posts\nwhich works well with sharing /dev/input/event* devices, something which doesn't seem possible with\nUSB/IP (I probably won't be able to share input from my mobile phone's power button to my laptop with USB/IP,\nbut I got it working back then using netevent as mentioned in the linked post).\nOn the contrary, sharing USB devices (Yubikey [shows up in /dev/hidraw*], USB storage devices, etc.)\nisn't possible with netevent.\nThat said, both netevent and USB/IP still seem to have a bit of overlapping functionality (I should be able\nshare my USB Mouse and USB keyboard using either of USB/IP or netevent, as this'll be detected as a USB device\n[works with USB/IP], as well as show up in /dev/input/event* [works with netevent]).\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/11/14/sharing-yubikey-over-the-network/","title":"Sharing Yubikey over the network"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/12/09/debugging-wifi-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi/":{"body":"Unsupported WiFi channels\nMy place gets minor power outages time to time and without having a power backup to rely on, my home router\nand machines tend to go off. One peculiar thing I noticed is that about half the times when power did come\nback, my Raspberry Pi 4 would fail to connect back to my WiFi router, even when my other machines connected to\nWiFi just fine. Also my Pi runs headless with no immediate access to a monitor or an ethernet cable combined\nwith laziness didn't help debugging in what could've been going wrong.\nInitial few times I shrugged it off about WiFi being WiFi, as rebooting my router/Pi would usually bring my Pi\nback online. It was annoying nonetheless, say I was outside and wanted to monitor some sensors in my house, a\nlil power trip would end up causing problem with this. I tried disabling WiFi power saving settings on my\nPi. There's resources on this issue, such as\nthis.\nThe problem still remained but I can't say for sure if it may or may have not have helped with a different\nbut a related problem.\nGiving some thought, I realized I have a USB to TTL\nadapter and few jumper cables around which'll allow me to access Pi's serial console through my lappy, all\nwithout having my Pi on network. This seemed like a good enough first step to figure out what could've been\ngoing wrong with my Pi not connecting back to my home WiFi after a power outage.\n\n  \n  USB to TTL adapter\n\nThere's lots of resources out there on how to set up UART to access the serial console on Pi using USB to TTL.\n\nThe Culprit\nOnce I got the above all set up. The next time Pi refused to connect to my home WiFi, I logged into my Pi using:\n\nand tried doing the usual network checkups.\nping google.com fails.\nifconfig says no IP assigned to wlan0.\nSeems Pi isn't connected to WiFi after all.\nI tried scanning for WiFi networks around me using:\n\nI think nmcli nmtui commands do not work unless you're using NetworkManager. So make sure to switch\nto NetworkManager from dhcpcd (which is the default as of writing) using sudo raspi-config.\nAnd my home WiFi doesn't show up.\nTurned on my phone's WiFi access point mode, rescanned WiFi networks, okay this showed up in nmcli, but for\nsome reason home WiFi still didn't.\nAt this point, it almost felt as if my Pi got so tired of always having to connect to my home WiFi that it\nevolved in ways to intentionally ignore my home WiFi.\nRebooted my Pi, still seemed mad at WiFi. Again. Still mad.\nNo nothing. So eventually also brought in my WiFi router into this reboot chaos.\nEventually eventually after a couple power cycles each, yess it connected happy!\nI got suspicious of what radio channel was my home's WiFi access point listening for clients to connect on,\nsince this seemed a thing that fit into the signs and also that on what WiFi channel a router listens on\nusually defaults to automatic. This could mean the channel my router preferred to listen on could change post\nevery power cycle.\nResearching up a bit, it seems I can check out what WiFi channels my Pi 4 supports using:\n\nand comparing these what my router provides:\n\n  \n  2.4GHz channels\n  \n  \n  \n  5GHz channels\n\nIt looks there are some channels my router can listen on to but which aren't supported by Pi.\nI was able to replicate the problem of Pi not \"seeing\" my home WiFi after I set my router to listen on a\nchannel unsupported by my Pi.\nI also read around that setting your WLAN country in sudo raspi-config should make it so that my Pi\nlistens only on WiFi channels legalized in my country. This was already set to my country code. I tried\nskimming in my router settings to find something similar but no avail here. But it's ok, my router allows\nme to bind it to listen on a specific WiFi channel, and anything that the Pi is capable of listening on\nshould be fine for my case. So I did it. And having me closely keep a track of this for about a week or a two,\ndidn't notice the problem of my Pi not connecting my WiFi after a power outage cycle happen again.\nConflicting Docker Interfaces\nAfter I set up some Docker stacks, I noticed a similar problem of my Pi losing WiFi connection would happen\nrandomly at times. Looking up, it seems Docker is notorious for this problem where it messes with the default\nnetwork routes (that provide actual Internet). It seemed the problem went away once I replaced my\nNetworkManager.conf to ignore virtual network interfaces created by Docker and Tailscale, using the following\ncontents:\n\nMake sure you're using NetworkManager to manager network interfaces (and not dhcpcd or anything else)\nfor this to work.\n\nWiFi is still WiFi, so until next time.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/12/09/debugging-wifi-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi/","title":"Debugging WiFi on a headless Raspberry Pi"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/12/26/homelabbing-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/":{"body":"I've had to constantly declutter my photos and documents stored on Google Drive as I've been running\nlow on the 15 GB free-tier storage since a while.

I've made rough pointers\non technical considerations/ramifications I've had to deal with during the process, that I wanted to\narchive here in more detail.\n\nHardware\nI recently got a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB model) and reading up seems like Immich worked fine on one. So I decided\nto get into this with my RPi4.\nArchitecture\nRPi4 is ARM 64-bit. Generally, I've read software support for ARM 64-bit isn't quite yet up to the par with\nx86 systems. I've low-key faced this problem myself when setting up a few services later on\n(say TubeArchivist), it takes a bit of researching but so\nfar I've always been lucky enough to be able to get away with things working fine in my case eventually.\nOS\nI'll be running Raspberry Pi OS lite (64-bit) headlessly on my Pi and doing things later on via SSH.\nI've also kept a USB to TTL adapter connected to the GPIO pins, it's been immensely useful\nin debugging whenever I wasn't able to access my Pi through SSH and and network issues.\nStorage\nInitially, my boot and root filesystems were present on a MicroSD card plugged into my RPi, and I'd be storing\nmy Immich photos on a USB 3.0 external SSD plugged into my RPi.\nSince, RPi4 supports USB boot, I later on decided to move away completely from MicroSD cards to SSDs for\nall storage as MicroSD cards seem a bit fragile to me both physically and circuitry wise, and also due to\nthe reason that now I'd have 2 different storage devices (failure points) working in conjunction to achieve\none goal of self-hosting my services.\nI also decided to get a newer NVMe SSD with a USB 3.0 enclosure instead of using a USB 3.0 external SSD.\nI had my reasons for this:\n• USB 3.0 external SSD could get difficult to work with if their USB 3.0 connector gets damaged. This shouldn't\nbe a problem with NVMe SSD with USB enclosure. In the case the USB connector of the enclosure were to get\ndamaged, I could get a new USB enclosure and get back to normal working immediately.\n• It can be re-used as internal storage in machines with PCIe slot.\n• NVMe is faster (though in my case, USB 3.0 speeds will probably bottleneck before anything else).\n• My old SSD couldn't store as much and the combination of getting a reputable NVMe SSD + USB enclosure\nwas cheaper to get than a USB 3.0 external SSD with the same amount of storage in my place.\nPartioning\nWith now everything on my SSD, I had to think of how to best partition filesystems on it. I also got to\nresearch about lesser-known filesystems like ZFS, BTRFS during this time. I went ahead with this partitioning:\nBootFS and RootFS:\n\nThen a logical partition with 2 LUKS encrypted partitions under it:\n\nAnd a 16GB reserved space (also under the previously created logical partition) after the BTRFS partition\nsince I've read around BTRFS dealing defragmentation can at times leave partition out of space, so this\nlittle reserve might come in handy. I can use this reserve as LUKS encrypted swap space other times if\nneeded.\n\nI went ahead with using ext4 with my RootFS as I've never tried other filesystems and BTRFS (unlike traditional\nfilesystems like ext4) has a bit of a learning curve in order to personalize it as per our requirements,\nso didn't want to put my eggs in the same basket all at once while I'm still relatively new to it.\nHere's the mount options that I've been using with BTRFS as of writing:\n\nIt's also a good idea to make our mount point read-only when nothing's mounted to it. To do so, make sure nothing's\nmounted to our mount point and then set +i attribute on the mount point directory:\n\nAt the time of writing mainline kernel for RPi4 points to the 6.1.y tree. I read around there were BTRFS\nrelated improvements made in the newer kernels, so I was able to update my kernel with to the 6.6.y tree with:\n\nand things have been stable so far with a month or two since the update.\nYou can see which branch is the newer kernel version here and pass it\nto rpi-update.\nI used ext4 with /var/lib/docker/ as it looks to be a place with high rate of read and writes, something\nBTRFS to me still seems dicey with after researching around.\nLow-RAM Issues\nImmich alone mentions these requirements as of writing this:\n\nOS: Preferred unix-based operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, MacOS, etc). Windows works too, with Docker Desktop on Windows\nRAM: At least 4GB, preferred 6GB.\nCPU: At least 2 cores, preferred 4 cores.\n\nAfter hosting quite a a few services besides Immich; the 4GB RAM on RPi4 did turn out to be a bottleneck after\na while. Pi would start to freeze up and in the scenario it did let me SSH into it (I didn't had the USB to\nTTL thing set up yet) and do btop, it indeed seemed to be struggling with RAM while kswapd was seen\nto be hogging up all the CPU. And then sometimes the OOM killer kicked in and everything was a mess.\nI set aside 16 GB swap space on my SSD and freezes went away, but soon I learned about zram (a Linux kernel\nmodule for compressing data before storing it on RAM) and I decided to set it up to reduce SSD wear as well\nas coming across convincing-enough claims about it having better read/write speeds when compared to swapping\non SSD (despite the de/compression CPU overhead).\nZRAM\nI used zram-swap to set up zram.\nInitially, I went ahead with lz4 compression as it seemed a good speed vs compression ratio trade-off on\npaper. I set up 2GB (out of the 4GB) of RAM to be utilized as zram with this sysctl config:\n\nIn practise however, lz4 for me seems\nto cause lots of CPU cycles on kswapd, keeping CPU usage to around 100% all the time. Researching around,\nI came across this reddit comment\nmentioning lz4 being suspectible to OOM.\nLater on, I moved to zstd and used 1/3 out of the 4GB RAM (so 1.33 GB RAM as zram) with this sysctl config:\n\nzstd has better compression ratio with lower speeds\nthan lz4 on paper. I've noticed when self-hosting CPU mostly stays on idle workload most of the time and\ngets bursts of heavy lifting time to time, so zstd shouldn't be so bad (it's still much much faster than swap\non disk). Interestingly, CPU hogging problem that I faced with lz4 went away with zstd.\nOverheating\nWithout any way to control heat, my Pi would quickly reach temperatures around 85°C on load which seems\nto kick-in thermal throttling. The official RPi4 case made it worse.\nI then got an aluminium passive cooling case. The temperatures still get around 80° but now take\ncouple minutes on constant load to get there, and I haven't come across any noticeable throttling so far.\nSo I've been keeping this.\nSoftware\nDocker\nWith self-hosting things, it can quickly get overwhelming to keep track of any vulnerabilities, updates,\nbreaking dependencies, so much more. Docker with portainer keep it good enough to help me deal with this.\nThis works well as I've noticed almost every self-hostable solution adds in support for Docker and provide\nexample stack configurations that can be plugged into portainer (or directly into docker). Spend some time\nlearning to manage volumes in docker to get an idea about how persistent storage works. Losing important\ndata when a running container goes down is no good.\n\nSecurity Note\nGive special emphasis to running containers only with non-root users, and only\nmake very specific host OS's volumes accessible from within the container whenever required. Say, if we\nwant to use syncthing to sync your music from the directory\n/media/files/music/ between other syncthing hosts, then only provide this very specific path\n/media/files/music/ to syncthing's docker container. Do not provide access to blanket volumes such as\n/media/ or /media/files/ when creating the container (either with docker run or with docker compose).\nIf a bad actor exploits a vulnerability in a service running inside our container, the best (worst) they\ncould do is gain a reverse shell into our container. At the moment, it seems very difficult to break outside\nof a docker container (through the container's shell or anything) to gain access to the host OS. So it's\nimportant to minimize the level of access the user has from within the container.\n\nI also like having this section for my docker compose configurations whenever necessary:\n\nIt lets this docker compose service access services bound on my host OS's network interfaces, from within\nthe container.\nI think it's a good idea to make portainer's data persistent on filesystem. It helps preserve\ndocker compose files for all the services which've been set up using portainer. So make sure to set\nthe volume correctly when installing portainer.\nWiFi Issues\nI've had problems with having my Pi long-term stay connected to my WiFi access point. There's a separate\npost I wrote on it\nrecently.\nDecrypting LUKS\nThis is a preference on how someone'd like to decrypt their encrypted partitions when mounting.\nI've done a little shell script that I need to manually call that asks me for my LUKS passphrase/passfile\nand mounts the decrypted partitions with my favourite mount options:\n\nBackups\nBorg or Kopia both work decent\nfor me with both onsite and offsite backups. I've set them up through portainer as well, both on my Pi and\nthe secondary machines that keep the backups. I've found that Kopia needs https set up at least on the\noffsite repository server to work correctly. tailscale cert worked nice when setting up https for services\nrunning inside my private tailscale network.\nI was also interested in \"backing up\" docker compose files for the services running on my offsite backup\nmachine. I was able to get this done by setting up syncthing\nfor my backup machine's persistent portainer data volume directory, between my main machine and my offsite\nbackup machine. This keeps my offiste backup machine's docker compose files synced up with my main machine.\nI like to keep my personal stuff and docker specific persistent data separately. Since, for my usecases,\ndocker specific data is a place of more frequent write rates when compared to my personal stuff which I\ndon't mess with as frequently.\nThis is how my directory tree looks like:\n\nThis makes setting up different backup policies for different directories a bit easier, such as I like to\ntake automated backup snapshots of my docker data directory more often than the my personal stuff directory.\n\n  \n  See? it's chilling now\n\nRandom Freezes\nThere are very good chances that my machine could freeze up tinkering around if I happen to run anything\nmemory intensive or a running process ends up doing something funny. I've watchdog setup to reboot my machine\nautomatically after 10 minutes in case it detects an anomly.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2023/12/26/homelabbing-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/","title":"Homelabbing on a Raspberry Pi 4"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2024/08/10/docker-freezes-machine-by-spiking-up-cpu-io-to-100/":{"body":"..on an RPi5\nI've since moved from micro-homelabbing on an RPi4\nto an RPi5 now. I use the official power adapter as well as the active cooler, and have connected my NVMe drive through RPi5's\nPCIe slot (over Pimoroni's NVMe Base).\nDuring migration from RPi4 to RPi5, I decided to format a new MicroSD card to make sure the new RPi5 kernel'll support\nall the new hardware present in RPi5. Before the migration, I double-checked to make sure everything homelabby that needed\nto be persisted resided on my NVMe disk, and that nothing important resided in /var/lib/docker/volumes\n(just had nukeable logs and some redis related cache there!).\nProblematic CPU I/O\nThat done, now a couple months later I've noticed my CPU I/O would spike up to 100 and stayed on it until my RPi5\ncame to a grinding halt. This spike would happen whenever I were to mount my LUKS + BTRFS NVMe drive and launch dockerd's\nsystemd service. It has also been interesting to notice that this I/O spike wasn't caused overnight. I've noticed it\ngradually building up every successive time I mounted my drive and launched dockerd. It was only until recently that I\nupgraded my kernel from 6.6.y to 6.9.y using rpi-update, rebooted my RPi5, and on mounting my drive + launching dockerd\nthat it started to freeze up the entire system during dockerd attempting to start my docker-compose swarms.

The members of this nuclear family all live a life that\nrequires them to spend a part of the day outside the house. Parents go out to attend work. The kids have school.\nKnowing that there'll be no one (or worse, only kids) in the house for a period of time everyday, the family\nrealized it'd be nice to secure the perimeter of the house by setting up surveillance cameras. The family members consume technology but they aren't very technical themselves. They research a bit around before deciding on\nthe cameras they'll use to set the surveillance up using.\n\"Honey. These surveillance cameras also have a mobile app. It says so on the website.\"\n\"What if there happens to be an electricity cut? Cameras gonna go off.\"\n\"Humm. Yeah.\"\n\"Oh, found them. These ones have an internal battery that says it should last the camera for 2 hours.\"\n\"These cameras work on WiFi, but that's fine as we've already got our ONT on a UPS backup.\"\n\"Awesome! Karen from my office also uses similar cameras for their home.\"\n\"Let's get these!\"\nThe family gets some nice cameras that they fit around the house. Their phones don't have to be connected to\ntheir home WiFi since these \"nice\" cameras have come with a mobile app that allows them to see the video feed\nof their cameras even if they are outside of their home. This means, the family can monitor their cameras from\ntheir office workplace.\nIt's been a few months now with the cameras installed. Their house is safe. The mobile app notifies the\nparents when their kids have returned safely from school. They're able to monitor their house during the\noccasional power-outages. The video feeds stay on the (camera company's proprietary) cloud. Which is cool\nas the parents are now able to access the past video feeds, even when the cameras are turned off.\nEverything's looking good.\nOne day, dad gets a notification on his phone from the camera's mobile app: \"Human presence detected!\".\nDad thinks to himself without checking the camera feed:\n\"Oh cool. Wifey's sandals must be here.\"\nHe expects to receive a call from the delivery guy since the front door is locked.\n\"It's been a while, what's the guy doing..?\"\nCasually opens the camera app on his phone.\nHe sees two people with their faces masked up. They are leaving the house with a few sacks in their hands\nto a car parked near the family's house. That spikes up dad's anxiety.\n\"...the heck?!\"\nDials up 911 (or the equivalent) to send a dispatch to their house.\n\"Wait. This video feed was recorded 3 hours ago?!\"\nThat is interesting. Why did the notification showed up now and not while the burglary was unfolding? Did the\ncameras mess up?\nWas it the software? Did the internet go down? No, that can't be so. The internet hardly ever goes down\nthis area, let alone such a coincidence with the robbery.\nThe master power control is present inside the house itself. It would've been very difficult to turn down\nthe power without first breaking into the house, which doesn't make sense as he'd have gotten the\nnotification if the burglars tried doing so. Also, the UPS would've lasted them a couple hours, both the\ncameras and their home internet.\nWhat could've gone wrong here?\nOne plausible possibility seems like the camera software indeed messed up somewhere.\nMaybe the camera software for some reason failed to send a motion event to the company's proprietary cloud.\nMaybe the company's cloud software failed to notify dad and mom's mobile app.\nMaybe the camera failed to detect the humans wearing masks over their face as humans, since we had to\ndisable object detection due to high rate of false-positives in motion detection due the plants moving\nwith the wind.\nMaybe the camera firmware auto-updated and broke itself yesterday.\nMaybe the mobile app and notifications have been broken since the last update on the playstore/appstore\nwhich happened a few days ago.\nYou can self-host all the above parts of software to get more fine control over the devices you own, which run\nthe above mentioned software, to reduce the possibility of the above issues. I feel this can easily take a\nmonth to get into and solve the problem to a good extent, given the person is supposed to show up at their\noffice on weekdays and the person is technical enough to even consider attempting to solve the problem in\nthe first place.\nDealing with all of the above is something pretty much out of the question for your average neighbour.\nThe local police can't seem to get a grip on what happened. Of course, people change their clothes. and\nany physically wearable and social masks.\nHowever, the cameras and the company software were both godsend, so none of the above was an issue. It was\nseen in the recorded video feed later on that the burglars looked to be carrying some sort of antenna-based\ndevice?\n\"Wait. What is this antenna thingy that robbers look to have forgotten in our house??\"\nBombsquad made sure it's not a bomb.\nThe family clicked pictures of the thing. The next day, they sent it over to this young distant relative of\ntheirs.\n\"We occasionally ask him to fix our printer. A very nice guy.\"\nThe relative takes a while to get back.\n\"Hmm. Is it a Raspberry Pi? It looks a Raspberry Pi Zero. Hacked up to a battery backup?\"\n\"Oh, that antenna looks like an external WiFi adapter. I can read it saying ...ALFA??\"\nMy guess is the burglars connected an external WiFi adapter to a RPi Zero, constantly broadcasting deauth\npackets to the nearby APs, cough cough aircrack-ng is it called? Oh right, the family also used a WPA/WPA2\nsecure network. Isn't that what everybody sees when they're connecting to their favourite WiFi? Yeah, seems\nit's suspectible to an attack that forces the access point to drop any connected clients if it receives this\nspecially crafted network packet. This must've went on until the battery ran out and the RPi forced itself\noff from the lack of input power.\nThis exploit may not have worked with if the access point used was WPA3. But that is not what we're all doing,\nright?\n\"So you say our cameras wouldn't connect to our WiFi because of this thing nearby?\"\n\"But we tried to turn on this antenna thing using our uh.. what they call..

Although, the\nconfiguration must perform some kind of disk partitioning using disko, for nixos-anywhere to do\nits magic. Such an install should go smooth enough without the need of manual intervention at\nany step during the process.\nHowever, the flake-based NixOS configuration I'll be installing on a Vultr VPS is for a machine\nthat goes by clawsiecats. This machine configuration is publicly available here:\nhttps://github.com/ritiek/dotfiles/blob/2d99108/machines/clawsiecats\nIt enables all of the NixOS specific features mentioned above - BTRFS partitioning on LUKS,\nimpermanence, and secrets provisioning using sops-nix.\nThis is what makes things a little trickier. The rest of the post is mainly me talking about\nsetting up these features in NixOS configuration so that the configuration can be deployed using\nnixos-anywhere with the least amount of manual intervention, on a Vultr VPS (adaptable to\nother hosting providers usually, only difference should be the partitioning scheme [GPT/MBR]\nused by the hosting provider).\nIf the reader is following this guide with care then it's recommended to open\nthe above link to my machine's configuration (which is Vultr ready including all these features)\nand go through it side-by-side along with this\nguide as there are a lot of references to it to help things make sense.\nSecrets Provisioning (sops-nix)\nThere's agenix and many more that seem nice. Up to you. I'm currently using sops-nix so I'll\ndive into it here. Start by adding sops-nix as an input in your flake:\n\nsops-nix allows to provision machine specific secrets, and I tie my secret key to my machine's\nprivate SSH host key. I keep this private SSH host key unique for every machine configuration.\n\n\nsecrets.yaml can be edited using the following:\n\nRunning this may prompt for 2FA on our key, if it's set up.\nImpermanence\nThis seems mostly to be a NixOS concept mainly achieved by mounting / as tmpfs.\nThe idea, is that we perform bind mounts or create symlinks inside / that point to the actual\npersistent files and directories mounted somewhere else (this stuff we explicitly specify to\npreserve).\nThis is supposed to help mitigate the lingering build up of files that could potentially get\nin the way of purity of NixOS (we ideally wouldn't want a program to imperatively read and write\nits config in /etc/ in NixOS) as any residual files that get created in / will automatically\nbe cleaned up on reboot (since / is tmpfs living in memory or swap).\nI use impermanence in my configuration setup. Impermanence can be set up using custom solutions\nfor syncing / from our persistent storage. Anyway, I'll be using the impermanence module\nwhich seems to solve this pretty well (through bind mounts and symlinks). Add the module as an\ninput to your flake with:\n\nThere are a few important files present under / that should be persisted, such as host SSH\nkeys which we'll be persisting in the next step and /etc/machine-id which is what many\nprocesses depend on to identify themselves that they're running on the same machine in the\ncase the process restarts (we wouldn't want maybe ACME certificates to be re-generated on\nevery reboot since /etc/machine-id would be re-created if we were not to persist it).\nFor now, we'll generate a /etc/machine-id locally which we'll transfer to our target\nmachine later under the persistent storage.\nLet's create a directory on our local machine first where we'll store all the files that we'd\nlike to transfer to our target machine when nixos-anywhere gets invoked:\n\n\nBTRFS on LUKS\nNow to set up encryption at partition level. List disko as an input in your flake if not\nalready:\n\nand configure an encrypted partition, for example:\n\nThe way I currently deploy nixos-anywhere to handle LUKS using my configuration is - I first\ngenerate a random SSH key pair and store the private key from this key pair on the target\nNixOS machine, specifically here /boot/ssh_host_ed25519_key.\n\nThis private SSH key will be used for hosting a dropbear SSH server on initrd.\nI'll connect to this server and provide the key to decrypt my LUKS block device. This will\nallow the machine to boot into stage 2.\nAdd the following configuration to your target machine to setup the dropbear SSH server:\n\nI fetch my private SSH key for this machine which is also stored encrypted in my repository -\n./machines/secrets.yaml. This file would look something like this:\n\nThe file is encrypted through sops:\n\nI'll extract the private SSH key for the target configuration that I am to be deploying,\nand also store it a file:\n\n\nWe'll also store the public key corresponding to this private key:\n\nWe want NixOS on target machine to be able to access this decrypted private SSH key.\nThis step is important as this private key provides access to target machine configuration\nspecific secrets, listed in ./machines/clawsiecats/secrets.yaml\nWe'll need to push our LUKS key to the target machine so that the target machine can use it\nto encrypt the disk. Looks like nixos-anywhere has an option for this\n--disk-encryption-keys.\nInvoke nixos-anywhere\nWe'll be installing NixOS on a Vultr instance with only 1 GB RAM. When booting our 1 GB\ninstance with Debian, I've noticed that nixos-anywhere fails half-way due to target\nmachine running out of available memory.\nThis issue also happens if I boot the machine with official NixOS installer image, which is a\nbit surprising since in this case nixos-anywhere doesn't even call kexec. My idea was that\nsince kexec tends to load NixOS in memory when the base OS is not NixOS (the case with\nDebian), this leaves a bigger memory footprint. I was hoping it would be enough to start off\nwith the base OS as NixOS so that kexec doesn't get called, but alas.\nWith neither of these methods working, I tried writing my own minimal NixOS configuration with\nZRAM setup as linked below, which seems to work!\nhttps://github.com/ritiek/dotfiles/blob/2d99108/generators/minimal.nix\nReplace users.users.root.openssh.authorizedKeys.keys in the above configuration with how\nyou'll be identifying yourself.\nI build an ISO out of this configuration. This can be done by adding nix-generators as an\ninput in your flake.nix:\n\nand defining an output target, such as:\n\nand invoking:\n\nshould generate an image in ./result/iso/nixos-25.05.20250117.08a54ef-x86_64-linux.iso.\nIt's possible to upload and boot from a custom ISO image through the Vultr dashboard and that's\nwhat we'll do here with this generated image. We'll need to publicly host our image file\nsomehow since Vultr takes a URL to the custom image. Not covering this here.\nWe'll also need to remount the writable tmpfs nix store on our target machine to allocate more\nspace, otherwise nixos-anywhere tends to run out of space:\n\nWith all of this in place, invoking nixos-anywhere should now successfully do its thing!\nThis is how we'll invoke it so that it pushes the disk encryption key as well as the files\nthat we'd like to persist on our target NixOS machine:\n\nTo avoid this work every time we are to be deploying the configuration on a new machine, I've\nmade a script that'll automatically create SSH keys and other necessary files, remount the nix\nstore, push the files on to our target machine, and invoke nixos-anywhere with the right\nparameters:\nhttps://github.com/ritiek/dotfiles/blob/2d99108/machines/clawsiecats/anywhere.sh\nOnce we've the target machine booted into minimal NixOS ISO, we can call this script locally\nusing:\n\nThe installation should succeed and the machine should reboot automatically. We can now detach\nour minimal ISO image using the Vultr dashboard and have the machine boot into the NixOS we\njust installed. We'll need to SSH into port 2222 and enter the decryption key to move further\ninto the boot process:\n\nWe should now be dropped onto all the tooling and fluffiness defined in our flake:\n\nThat should be all!\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/02/10/nixos-on-1gb-vultr-vps-using-nixos-anywhere/","title":"NixOS on 1 GB Vultr VPS using nixos-anywhere"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/03/27/nixos-on-radxa-zero-3w/":{"body":"I was able to get NixOS working on Radxa Zero 3W!

Try out the following:\n\n\nFlash the image onto the microSD card.\n\n\nMount this flashed microSD card onto your local machine first and take note of the directory structure\npresent in the root partition.\n\n\nInsert this flashed SD card into Radxa Zero 3W and keep the board powered on for ~5 mins. If the boot\nsequence is working as expected, the software should perform nix path registrations on the first boot.\n\n\nNow pull out the microSD card from the board and mount it onto your local machine. If the directory\nstructure has changed considerably from before, and nix-path-registrations file is no longer present in the\nroot partition, that means the boot was a success!\n\n\nThat is pretty much it!

For now I had a coworker help me out with making temporary contacts\n(buying out some buffer tehee):\nBC101VE-11PUSB to TTL\n3V33V3\nGNDGND\nRXTX\nTXRX\n\nOn my Linux laptop connected over UART, the device showed up as /dev/ttyACM0. It could\ninstead also show up as /dev/USB0 or something. Verify once.\nSetting the baud rate to 115200 with picocom seems to have worked:\n\nIt also helps that my (and most other) USB to TTL devices flash a different LED whenever\ndata is being emitted over serial.\nI noticed my BC101VE-11P module flash the blue LED once and spew these logs over serial\neverytime I powered it up:\n\nAnd then it'd go silent afterwards and /dev/ttyACM0 device file would disappear.\nI guessed it to be a power issue or a bad USB to TTL adapter. I had a spare NodeMCU ESP8266\ndevelopment board that I had flashed Tasmota onto a while ago but hadn't configured it any\nfurther, so it'd still be broadcasting tasmota's default AP when it's powered on properly.\n\n\n  \n  NodeMCU ESP8266 Development Board\n\nI tried to power up the NodeMCU through the 3v3 rail:\nNodeMCU ESP8266USB to TTL\n3V33V3\nGNDGND\n\nAnd the tasmota's AP didn't show up either! Although, powering it up through the 5V rail\nseems to have worked and I could see tasmota's AP and connect over to 192.168.4.1 on the\nAP just fine:\nNodeMCU ESP8266USB to TTL\n5V5V\nGNDGND\n\nSo, it's very likely a power issue where my machine's USB port or the USB to TTL adapter\nisn't able to compensate for the additional demand in current when the voltage is lowered\nto 3.3V, in order to supply the same power as on a 5V rail.\nSadly the BC101VE-11P accepts only 3.3V input and not a 5V input. For the sake of it, I decided\nto power up the BC101VE-11P module over 3.3V but with the USB to TTL now connected to a wall\nadapter:\nBC101VE-11PUSB to TTL\n3V33V3\nGNDGND\n\nNoticed a slight change in the behaviour of the blue onboard LED this time. The LED now blinked\nevery second instead of previously flashing once and shutting down when connected to my machine\nover USB. This behaviour was consistent.\n\nDecided to give another try to power up my spare NodeMCU ESP8266 through the 5V rail on my USB\nto TTY adapter connected to my machine's USB port where the NodeMCU would in-turn power up the\nBC101VE-11P through one of the 3V3 output pins present on the development board:\nNodeMCU ESP8266USB to TTL\n5V5V\nGNDGND\n\nNodeMCU ESP8266BC101VE-11P\n3V33V3\nGNDGND\n\nThis gave me a solid light up of blue LED onboard. Additionally, hooking up the RX and TX connections\ndirectly to the BC101VE-11 from my USB to TTL looked to be giving logs properly over serial now:\nBC101VE-11PUSB to TTL\nRXTX\nTXRX\n\n\nI got the above logs from the stock vendor firmware present on thGe BC101VE-11P. It mentions\nInitializing TCP/IP stack and tcp_port:60670 (pretty much used by Tuya) which hints that\nthe module is powered up and operating properly. I could also see the module showing up as\n\"online\" in the vendor shipped Android app at this point.\nFlashing OpenBeken\nSo far so good with the pins on BC101VE-11P matching with the ones mentioned in the official\ndocumentation as well as present on ESP8685-WROOM-03.\nNow to find out what pin boots the BC101VE-11P into UART flash/download mode. This doesn't\nseem to be clearly documented in the official datasheet.\nThe datasheet on the ESP8685-WROOM-03 by Espressif mentions the following:\n\n  \n  Chip Boot Mode Control on ESP8685-WROOM-03\n\nWhich doesn't make much sense as there's no pin labelled as GPIO8 on my BC101VE-11P (what pin\nshould I pull-up/provide 3.3V to for booting into joint download boot mode?).\nI also came across this document on ESP8685-WROOM-03:\n\nhttps://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2AC7Z-ESP868503/5612045.pdf\nIt mentions:\n\nIO9 is internally logic high. If IO9 is set to pull-up, the Boot mode is selected. If this\npin is pull-down or left floating, the Download mode is selected. For more information on\nESP8685-WROOM-03, please refer to ESP8685-WROOM-03 Datasheet.\n\nOkay, both the above sources mention about pulling-down GPIO9 to for download mode. Let's just\ntry this and forget about the GPIO8 for now. However, as I mentioned before, the test pin points\npresent in the middle of the SoC do not the match between both the modules.\nThis is inconvenient because now I'm not sure what pin on the BC101VE-11P corresponds to\nGPIO9.\nI got the top and bottom pins soldered on the module from a local shop to make everything\nmanageable. The necessary ones are 3V3, GND, RX, TX.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  Some nice soldering!\n\nAnd then connecting the pins all over again:\nNodeMCU ESP8266USB to TTL\n5V5V\nGNDGND\n\nNodeMCU ESP8266BC101VE-11P\n3V33V3\nGNDGND\n\nBC101VE-11PUSB to TTL\nRXTX\nTXRX\n\n\n  \n  Yay it works!\n\n\n  \n  UART logs show up fine as well\n\nI had to do some experimenting to try to boot the module into download mode. I connected the\nmodule to my lappy through UART and ran a loop to try dump the firmware from the flash:\n\nThe 0x200000 because BC101VE-11P is mentioned to have 2MB of flash storage.\nThen I pulled-down each of the test pins using my fingers to bring one end of the jumper cable\nin contact with GND temporarily, and then rebooting the module (by re-connecting 3V3 or GND).\nOne pin at a time.\nAfter some fighting, I found that pulling-down one of the following points (as circled orange\nin the picture below) allowed my lappy to dump the flash! This means the module went into\ndownload mode.\n\n  \n  Pulling-down one of these pins causes themodule to boot into download mode\n\nSo to boot into download mode, additionally make one of these contacts:\nNodeMCU ESP8266BC101VE-11P\nGND&lt;Unknown Pin-1&gt;\nGND&lt;Unknown Pin-2&gt;\n\nSometimes if one of the encircled pin didn't work, then the other encircled pin worked into\nbooting the module into download mode most times.\nOnce I had a backup of the stock firmware done, I downloaded the latest OpenBeken release for\nBK7238 for UART Flash from:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/releases\nand flashed it onto my module using:\n\nI had to also to pass -B flag to overwrite the bootloader. Before deciding to overwrite the\nbootloader, make sure you've taken a dump of the stock firmware. This is supposed to be risky.\nAfter the flashing was performed successfully, I rebooted the module into normal mode.\nPost this I am unable to see any logs through UART. However, an access point with its SSID\n\"OpenBK7238_xxxxxxxx\" did start to show up. Connecting to it and accessing 192.168.4.1\nin the webbrowser looks to have worked!\n[TBD] Configuration\n[Need to work on this section]\nI configured OpenBeken to connect to my Wi-Fi router. OpenBeken offers a GPIO testing tool\nunder the Launch Web Application option accessible through the OpenBeken webserver running\non the module. I figured the blue LED is connected invertedly to GPIO6 and the push button\non the switch is connected to GPIO10.\nI still need to figure out what GPIO pin the relay is connected to, something I'll be\nable to do when I can get the plastic enclosure up and connect it 220V AC using pogo pins,\nwhich I believe should power up the relay.\n\n  \n  My switch running OpenBeken v1.18.138\n\nThis is the configuration that shows up on my Web Application as of now:\n\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/07/27/flashing-openbeken-on-3-pin-wifi-switch-based-on-bc101ve-11p/","title":"Flashing OpenBeken on 3-pin Wi-Fi switch based on BC101VE-11P (BK7238)"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/09/09/re-doing-my-homelab-with-nixos/":{"body":"It's been close to 2 years since my earlier homelab post (here).\nI moved onto a shiny Raspberry Pi 5 shortly afterwards (from an RPi4) and worked on a few things. This\npost is a continuity to how things have evolved in terms of my requirements and the solutions I now see\nas a better fit.\nThe biggest change has been me migrating everything to NixOS, and it's been transformative for how I think about managing my homelab infrastructure.\nWhy NixOS for a homelab?\nWhen I first started self-hosting, I was managing services the traditional way: installing packages directly on the system, editing config files scattered across /etc/, and hoping I'd remember all the changes I made when something broke.\nNixOS seems to help with this. Instead of imperatively configuring your system, you declare what you want in a configuration file, and NixOS builds the entire system through it. This means I can completely recreate my homelab setup on a fresh Raspberry Pi just by copying over my configuration files.\nI've slowly migrated most of my machines to run NixOS, including my RPi5 role-playing as homelab. Diving\ninto NixOS has been one of the few significant investments that I'm really happy about. Beyond the obvious reproducibility benefits, NixOS fundamentally changes how I think about system complexity.\nMy current NixOS configuration can be found here. All the techniques I discuss below are implemented in this config, so you can see exactly how they work in practice.\nMy approach to self-hosting\nI got into self-hosting mostly because it seemed fun and tinkerable. However, with time it's become\npretty important to me, more so to resist stashing away more of my digital identity within walled gardens.\nI tend to approach hosting services for personal use with a very long-term perspective. I've got services\nlike Immich (photo management) and paperless-ngx (document organization) that I've spent time curating carefully. They hold important paperwork and memories of loved ones. Lately I try to approach preserving them in a way I hope will outlive me, at least for a while.\nI mainly run a few scheduled jobs and otherwise host services that tend to run idle most of the time, so\na low-powered and power-efficient machine like Raspberry Pis seems like a good deal to me. In the cases I\ncould use more power (such as AI inference or gaming with Sunshine game streaming), I'm okay with a little bit of wait and\noffloading processing to a beefier machine.\nSetting up a NixOS homelab from scratch\nOne of the most satisfying aspects of NixOS is how I can generate a complete system image from my configuration. Here's my typical workflow when setting up or rebuilding my homelab:\nBuilding and deploying the system\nNixOS lets me generate an image file of my entire configuration that I can\nthen write directly to a microSD card. It'll boot up on my Pi with all my\nfavorite packages pre-installed and my environment exactly as defined. However, since I use sops-nix to\nstore encrypted secrets directly in my config, there are a few additional steps I need to perform to get my homelab-specific private SSH key in place (this key allows sops-nix to decrypt my secrets).\nThe process looks like this:\n\n\nBuild the system image (preferably using an ARM64 machine for native compilation):\n\n\n\nWrite the image to microSD:\n\n\n\nInitial boot setup: Plug the microSD into my Pi and power it up.\n\n\nAdd the decryption key: Wait 3-4 minutes for the Pi to set up its directory structure, then power off and mount the microSD on another machine to place my private SSH key into Pi's /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key (I wonder if it's possible to automate this step by inserting in a Yubikey at boot).\n\n\nFinal boot: Plug the microSD back into the Pi and boot it up.\n\n\nThat's it! I can now SSH into my Pi and be greeted with my complete environment. I can start my services using sudo homelab-start, which I've defined in my flake config.\nNo more spending hours trying to remember how I configured something months ago.\nAutomating software updates safely\nOne challenge I faced early on was keeping my NixOS system updated. I initially started with NixOS stable channels, but quickly realized my favorite new features in tools like Hyprland (a tiling window manager) sometimes take a while to hit stable channels. I also had issues with screen-sharing.\nI moved to unstable channels, but had a similar feeling of being a bit behind. Eventually, I decided to track nixpkgs master branch directly for the latest everything.\nThis created three problems I needed to solve:\n\nStaying current: Updates should track upstream as closely as possible\nAvoiding broken updates: Don't start an update if packages will break halfway through\nReducing compilation time: Avoid compiling everything on my local machines (since NixOS builds up official cache only once the packages reach unstable channels)\n\nMy automated update solution\nHere's the system I've developed and it's been running rock-solid for months:\nDaily automated testing: GitHub Actions creates a pull request to my dotfiles repository every day with the most up-to-date package versions in my flake.lock file. For every such update, GitHub Actions attempts to build all packages for all my machines and pushes the resulting build cache to my RPi5.\nBinary cache hosting: My RPi5 hosts an Attic server (think of it as a self-hosted binary cache for Nix packages). GitHub Actions can reach my RPi5 through my Headscale network (my personal VPN control server hosted on a VPS).\nChecks: The PR only gets a green checkmark if all packages build successfully on all my machines. This means the update will go through successfully everywhere since I share my flake.lock between machines.\nYou can see an example of this automated process in this PR.\nManual approval: I only accept updates by merging green PRs. After merging, I manually run git pull and sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#my-machine on each machine. The build cache gets pulled from my RPi5's Attic server, so updates are fast.\nRecovery options: If there's a runtime bug (not caught at compile time), I have two options:\n\nRollback to the previous NixOS generation and wait for the bug to be fixed upstream\nRevert just the problematic package by pinning it to an older nixpkgs version\n\nThis setup gives me bleeding-edge packages with confidence that they'll actually work. Since implementing this system a few months ago, I haven't come across pushing any failing updates onto my machines.\nBackups with Restic\nI moved from Kopia to Restic for backups because a single Kopia instance doesn't support backing up to multiple repositories, and I didn't want to maintain multiple Kopia instances. NixOS has a native Restic module that gives fine control over backup schedules, snapshot pruning, compression levels, and more.\nWhy Restic works well in my setup\nVersion compatibility: My Restic backup servers and clients run on different machines, but they stay compatible because they use the same flake.lock file. All my machines run the same Restic version, so I never worry about client-server version mismatches.\nEncrypted credentials: I store backup passwords and repository credentials encrypted using sops-nix, so they're version-controlled but secure.\nMonitoring integration: My backup jobs send success/failure notifications to my self-hosted Uptime Kuma monitoring server (also running on the RPi5).\nTesting system recovery\nFor the system itself (not just data), I periodically test my disaster recovery process. I'll use my RPi4 to build a fresh image for my RPi5, flash it to a new microSD card, and boot my RPi5 from the new card. This simulates a \"the microSD died\" scenario and ensures I can actually recover my complete system setup.\nMy Restic configuration files are available in my dotfiles: client config and server config.\nOn-demand services to save memory\nRunning lots of containers on my RPi5's 8GB of RAM eventually became a bottleneck, even with zram compression. Rather than buying more hardware, I researched running non-essential services on-demand (when someone actually tries to access them).\nHow on-demand services work\nServices like Navidrome (music streaming), TubeArchivist (YouTube archival), and Memos (note-taking) don't need to run 24/7. I'm okay waiting a few seconds for these to start up when I want to use them.\nHere's the technique I developed:\n\nPort monitoring: socat listens for connections on the service's normal port\nService startup: When a connection is detected, the actual service launches on an internal port\nProxy mode: socat forwards requests to the now-running service\nAutomatic shutdown: A monitor checks for active connections every ~10 minutes. If there are none, the service stops and socat resumes listening\n\nYou can see this implemented for Navidrome here.\nThis setup has freed up 1-2GB of physical memory (or 7-8GB accounting for zram compression) when services are idle. That's significant on an 8GB machine. I've extended this pattern to several other services like Mealie (recipe management) and HomeBox (inventory tracking).\nThe user experience is alrightish. These services usually start fast enough.\nExposing services securely\nSometimes I need to share a service running on my RPi5 with friends or family who aren't part of my Tailscale network. For these cases, I run a reverse proxy using Nginx on my personal VPS, which routes requests through my RPi5 over my Headscale connection.\nThe VPS also runs NixOS. I can hand out a subdomain to friends, and they can access my service without needing special software or VPN access. More details about my VPS setup and how I use nixos-anywhere to install NixOS on providers that don't officially support it are here (Vultr and HostVDS for now).\nFuture plans: Wi-Fi router functionality\nThis is still an idea needing research, but I'm considering running a wireless access point from my RPi5. The goal would be to route all connected devices through a VPN automatically, avoiding the need to configure VPN on each device individually. I'd also like to explore OpenWrt-style features like VLANs for isolating sketchy IoT devices.\nThis appeals to me because I have a basic router and would rather avoid buying new hardware if I can integrate something like this into my RPi5 itself. It's currently connected to the Internet via an Ethernet cable anyway, so an access point off with this setup shouldn't be so bad I guess. NixOS on top should help me keep router-specific configuration manageable. I might do a post if this ever happens.\nPower consumption and hardware setup\nMy current setup includes three SSDs attached to my RPi5 and a few other peripherals:\n\nFirst NVMe using the Pimoroni NVMe Base (for primary data storage)\nSecond NVMe in a USB enclosure via USB 3.0 (for on-site backups)\nThird external SSD via USB 3.0 (for storing Attic build cache)\nOfficial active cooler (minimal power draw)\nUSB 2.0 Wi-Fi dongle (for experimental Wi-Fi router functionality)\n\nThis entire setup consumes about 7.5-8.0W at idle (measured with a local Kill-A-Watt equivalent) and peaks at 11-13W under load.\nWhen the two external drives suspend after periods of inactivity, power consumption further drops to around 6.5-7.2W at idle. I haven't seen it exceed 14W under load in real-world usage, which I'm happy with for the compute it provides.\nThe NixOS advantage for homelabs\nSimple things that used to require research and manual setup are now just configuration options. Take zram (memory compression) as an example: on other distributions, I'd need to find a userspace program, set up systemd services, and hope it all works together.\nWith NixOS, zram is a simple zramSwap.enable = true; or watchdog is systemd.settings.Manager.RuntimeWatchdogSec = 360; in my configuration. Although, this is not to say it's all glitters. It definitely has it quirks, but those somewhat make sense too when looking at them through the lens of NixOS trying to be as reproducible as possible.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/09/09/re-doing-my-homelab-with-nixos/","title":"Re-doing my Homelab with NixOS"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/10/01/extendable-170-point-breadboard-on-pimoroni-explorer-hat-pro/":{"body":"I got myself Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro for my Raspberry Pi 5 to make protoyping and playing around with\nelectronics a little easier!

To the point where it'd exhaust my (ISP-provided) router's DHCP reservation\nlist. Most of them are hosted with some kind of network service that I need to access every now and then.\nThis gets tricky, because it's acceptable for some of them to have downtime which causes my router to assign\na different IP address to these devices when they next come up online after their DHCP lease happens to have\nexpired. The router lets me reserve IP addresses for only a handful of devices before it\nstops accepting any more entries. Even so, I still have to remember and enter IP addresses around or worse -\nlook them up on my router's DHCP reservation list to figure out what hostname is assigned what IP address.\nI remember coming across mDNS in the past which'd let me resolve IP addresses by the device hostname.\nI used to be able to access Pi-hole by entering http://pihole.lan/ on one of my Pis inside the\nlocal network. Looking into it now, it seems mDNS requires special software to be installed on both the\nclient as well as the machine trying to access the client. I don't prefer setting up another software on my\nmachines. Nope, this solution isn't even practical for other devices on my local network like the ESP8266s.\nI wanted to resolve the machines on my local network through an easy to remember hostname but not in the\nmDNS way. Sounds like something I could do by setting my own DNS server inside the local network and then\nhave a DHCP server hand out this DNS server to the clients in the local network to resolve DNS queries.\nI already host Pi-hole that my devices use as a DNS server to help keep unwanted traffic off my network.\nKeeping my local DNS server updated\nIt'd be nice to update my local DNS server's mapping of hostnames to IP addresses as close to real time as\npossible as soon as a device on my local network gets assigned with an IP address. I could mostly identify\ndevices based on the MAC address of the connecting network interface.\nSo I prepared a mapping of MAC addresses to the hostname that I'd like them to resolve to, such as:\n\nThere are then two ways I could think of to achieve this. These are as described below.\n1. Host both my own DNS server as well as a DHCP server\nPi-hole has a built-in DHCP server. Every time it'd hand out an IP address, it'd map the MAC address of the\nclient that requested for DHCP allocation to the IP address it just handed out. This would look something\nlike this:\n\nPi-hole would then be able to take the MAC address to hostname mapping that I prepared previously and it\ncould then create a local DNS entry that'd map IP address to the corresponding hostname that I assigned to\na MAC address. These local DNS entries created would then look like this:\n\nPi-hole has a well-documented API to programmatically create local DNS entries that could work well for such\na case. This approach would also neatly update the DNS entries in real-time. All the locally assigned DNS\nentries would show up in Pi-hole WebUI in Settings -&gt; Local DNS Records. Any devices whose MAC addresses\nhaven't been accounted for in my MAC address to hostname mapping could get a hostname of, say\nunknown-device-AC-CA-BD-DB-CE-EC.pihole.\n2. Extract ARP table off my router\nFor the previous setup to work reliably, my Pi-hole needs to be on whenever my router is on. Right now, I’m\nnot sure I can keep the Pi-hole running all the time. I don’t want to add another device (even a small one\nlike a Raspberry Pi Zero W) just to run Pi-hole and handle DHCP, because that would introduce another failure\npoint in my network. To use Pi-hole for DHCP, I’d have to turn off the DHCP on my router. So, if Pi-hole\ngoes offline even while the router is working, devices still won’t be able to obtain IP address leases. It'd\nrequire both of them to be online at the same time for connections to work properly.\nI imagined I could extract the latest ARP table off my router which'd give me MAC address to IP address\nmapping, and then define new DNS entries based off my MAC address to hostname mapping that I created\npreviously. I'd then pass these DNS entries to my Pi-hole server so they can be resolved properly. I could\nset my Pi-hole's IP address as the DNS server to hand out when issuing DHCP leases. This can be done inside\nof my router's settings page. This would then assign Pi-hole as the DNS server to all the devices that are\npart of the local network.\nI went ahead with this approach given the drawbacks of the previous setup. With this approach, it doesn't\nmatter if my Pi-hole goes down, my machines would fallback to the next DNS server provided by DHCP as defined\nin my router and at worst my machines wouldn't be able to resolve any custom-defined hostnames. The internet\nand connections would still work normally otherwise. This implementation can be found in my Pi 5's NixOS\nconfig in this commit\n28bcb1b.\nIt's been less than a week, too soon to say but so far so good.\nI am able to extract the ARP table by\nauthenticating with the router programmatically on the HTTP port and then firing off another request to fetch\nthe relevant HTML page that contains the ARP table which can be parsed through regex. This procedure would\nlikely be different depending on the router firmware. Router and Pi-hole's\ncredentials are stored encrypted using sops-nix in the config itself. This systemd service runs every 30\nminutes and updates the Pi-hole DNS entries as per the extracted ARP table. This has one caveat that the\nlocal DNS could go out-of-date within those 30 minutes and would not be able to resolve any new IP address\nleases to custom-defined hostnames until the service runs again.\nI now point to my cameras in Frigate through my custom-assigned hostname. Both Frigate and Pi-hole run on\nthe same Pi 5 through different Docker compose configurations. I cannot access Pi-hole's container from inside Frigate using 127.0.0.1. I also can't use host.docker.internal to refer to my host machine as\nthis hostname would itself have to be resolved in the first place so Docker doesn't allow referring to DNS\nservers through hostname. To portably assign Pi-hole as a DNS server to Frigate, I had to set the DNS to\nBridge IP address utilized by my Docker socket as described in this commit\n9d27048.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/10/02/setup-local-network-hostname-resolution-through-pihole/","title":"Setup local network hostname resolution through Pi-hole"},"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/10/20/microsd-boot-partition-with-nvme-root-filesystem-on-raspberry-pi-5/":{"body":"I run NixOS on my Raspberry Pi 5. For a while I've been running everything off a microSD card, but\nI wanted to migrate to an NVMe drive connected through a M.2 HAT via the PCIe slot for better performance\nand reliability.\nI currently use the now deprecated raspberry-pi-nix\nflake to build an image for my RPi5. While I'd like to migrate to the actively maintained\nnixos-raspberrypi flake, I haven't gotten around to it yet.\nWhen using u-boot with this flake, it's currently unable to boot directly off NVMe on the Pi 5, so a\nhybrid boot approach with the microSD card is necessary.\nI found it's possible to set up a hybrid boot configuration - boot from the microSD card initially,\nthen mount the NVMe drive as the root filesystem.

For example,\nthis issue tracks recently released improvements\nfor booting off NVMe drives connected through PCIe switches.\nI flashed Raspberry Pi OS to a separate microSD card, booted from it, and updated the bootloader\nfirmware directly from the command line:\n\nAlternatively, the bootloader can be updated through the interactive menu:\n\nThen navigate to Advanced Options → Bootloader Version → Latest.\nAfter the update completed, I rebooted and verified the firmware version:\n\nOnce confirmed the firmware was up to date, I proceeded with setting up the hybrid boot configuration.\nThe hybrid boot approach\nThe idea is simple: the Raspberry Pi 5 reads the boot partition from the microSD card to load the\nkernel and initial boot configuration, but then switches to using the NVMe drive for the actual\nroot filesystem.\nThe boot process works like this:\n\nRPi5 firmware reads the FAT32 boot partition on the microSD card (/dev/mmcblk0p1).\nIt loads the kernel and reads cmdline.txt which specifies the root partition.\nThe root partition specified in cmdline.txt points to the NVMe drive instead of the microSD card.\nSystem boots with NVMe as the root filesystem.\n\nSetting up the hybrid boot\nStep 1: Prepare cmdline.txt for delayed boot\nFirst, I needed to give the system enough time to detect the NVMe drive during boot.

The rootdelay=30 gives the\nsystem 30 seconds to detect and initialize the NVMe drive before attempting to mount the root partition.\nOnce done, I unmounted the partition:\n\nStep 2: Clone the microSD card to NVMe\nNext, I cloned the entire microSD card contents to the NVMe drive (dangerous! this will wipe off the\nNVMe drive).\nI switched to a root shell to avoid permission issues with block device operations:\n\nThis took a while since it's copying everything bit-by-bit to the NVMe drive. The result is an exact\nduplicate of the microSD card on the NVMe.\nStep 3: Modify partition identifiers to avoid conflicts\nHere's the tricky part - both the microSD card and NVMe now have identical partition UUIDs and labels,\nwhich would confuse the system about which partition to mount. Since I'm using the microSD card's boot\npartition and the NVMe's root partition, I needed to change identifiers to avoid conflicts.\nImportant: Before making any changes, note down the current UUIDs, PARTUUIDs, and labels of all\npartitions on both the drive as well as the microSD card:\n\nSave this output somewhere safe. If something goes wrong, we'll need these values to revert the changes.\nSince the system will use the microSD card's boot partition and the NVMe's root partition, I needed\nto change identifiers on the unused partitions to avoid conflicts.\nFor the ext4 root partition on the microSD card (/dev/mmcblk0p2):\nI changed the microSD card's root partition identifiers so it won't conflict with the NVMe's root\npartition:\n\nThis partition can be kept as a backup root filesystem in case the NVMe fails, or repurposed for\nother storage needs.\nFor the FAT32 boot partition on the NVMe (/dev/sda1):\nI also changed the NVMe's boot partition identifiers so it won't conflict with the microSD card's\nboot partition:\n\nNote: The mlabel -N command takes an 8-digit hexadecimal value for the FAT32 volume serial number.\nWe only change the filesystem UUID of the NVMe boot partition, not the disk signature, because changing\nthe disk signature would alter the PARTUUID of /dev/sda2 which needs to remain stable for cmdline.txt\nto reference it correctly.\nStep 4: Verify cmdline.txt points to the correct partition\nThe cmdline.txt on the microSD card's boot partition should reference the NVMe's root partition.\nMine looks like this:\n\nThe root=PARTUUID=2178694e-02 should match the PARTUUID of the NVMe's root partition (/dev/sda2),\nnot the microSD card's root partition.\nThe PARTUUID of NVMe root partition can be verified with:\n\nThe output will show both the filesystem UUID and partition PARTUUID. Make sure the PARTUUID in\ncmdline.txt matches what you see for /dev/sda2.\nStep 5: Boot with both drives connected\nI connected both the microSD card and NVMe drive back into my RPi5 and powered it on. The system now:\n\nReads the boot partition from the microSD card.\nMounts the root filesystem from the NVMe drive.\nRuns NixOS entirely off the NVMe for all file operations.\n\nSuccess! My NixOS root partition now runs off the NVMe drive, giving me the performance and reliability\nI was looking for.\nExpanding the NVMe storage\nAfter getting the hybrid boot working, I realized the NVMe drive had much more space than the microSD\ncard I cloned from. The cloned root partition was only using the same amount of space as the original\nmicroSD card, leaving the rest of the NVMe drive unused.\nThe root partition on the NVMe can be resized to use all available space, or new partitions can be\ncreated for additional storage.\n","id":"https://ritiek.github.io/2025/10/20/microsd-boot-partition-with-nvme-root-filesystem-on-raspberry-pi-5/","title":"MicroSD Boot Partition with NVMe Root Filesystem on Raspberry Pi 5"},"https://ritiek.github.io/about/":{"body":"Hwello, wild hooman!
